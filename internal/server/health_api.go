// ── IT WAS MISSING, AND TWO THINGS DEPENDED ON IT ─────────────────────────
//
//	the container   `docker-compose.yml` runs
//	                `wget -qO- http://127.0.0.1:3081/healthz` as its HEALTHCHECK.
//	                A port that 404s here comes up permanently unhealthy.
//	the app itself  `web/src/pages/settings.ts` and `web/src/account.ts` both
//	                fetch it for the version string. Those were failing silently
//	                — each guards on `d.version`, so a 404 shows a blank instead
//	                of an error.
//
// Found on 2026-08-29 by listing live's modules and asking which have no port
// equivalent. The endpoint audit could not have found it twice over: it
// only looked at `/api` paths, and its wildcard matcher treated Go's `{$}`
// end-of-path anchor as a segment wildcard, so `/{$}` "served" every
// single-segment path. Both are fixed.
//
// ── WHAT MAKES IT OK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `computeHealthStatus` is `startupReady && rosConnected && nothing stale`. The
// port has no per-collector freshness ledger, so the third clause has no
// equivalent yet and is NOT faked: reporting healthy on two of three checks is
// honest; inventing a `stale` array that is always empty would look like the
// third check passing.

	// ── NOTHING TO CONNECT TO IS NOT THE SAME AS FAILING TO CONNECT ───────
	//
	// `ok` was simply `connected`, and `activeRouterHealth` reports false when
	// no device is configured — so an install nobody had set up yet answered 503
	// for ever. Not even `starting`: past the grace window it was flatly
	// unhealthy, which is the state a fresh container is SUPPOSED to be in.
	//
	// THAT DEADLOCKED THE ROUTEROS APP INSTALL (issue #120,
	// `docs/routeros-container-install.md`): the App withholds its UI-URL until
	// the container reports healthy, the container was unhealthy until a device
	// existed, and a device can only be added through that UI. The reporter got
	// in by typing the address by hand, which is not something a first-time user
	// knows to do.
	//
	// So there are THREE states here, not two:
	//
	//	no device configured    healthy — there is nothing to be disconnected from
	//	device, not answered    starting, inside the grace window
	//	device, still silent    unhealthy, and an orchestrator should act
	//
	// Only the first is new. `deviceExpected` is what separates it from the
	// other two, and it is deliberately strict about not knowing: a fleet file
	// it cannot read counts as "a device is expected", so a corrupt
	// `routers.json` still reports unhealthy rather than being mistaken for a
	// fresh install.
	expected := s.deviceExpected()

	// STARTING is not FAILING. The live route distinguishes them so an
	// orchestrator does not kill a container that is still dialling: a 503
	// during the grace window is expected, and the body says which it is.

// ── SET TO MATCH THE LIVE APP, ON THE OPERATOR'S INSTRUCTION (2026-08-29) ──
//
// Reported as `version` on /healthz; `web/src/pages/settings.ts` and
// `web/src/account.ts` render `'v' + d.version`, so this is the bare number with
// no `v`.
//
// It is a CONSTANT rather than read from a file. The Node app read it from
// package.json, which no longer exists, and inventing a file to hold one number
// would add a build input for nothing. CLAUDE.md's rule still applies: a bump
// happens only when the operator says package it up, and one bump covers the
// whole session.
//
// 0.8.0 was the cutover release — the first on Go and TypeScript — but it never
// produced an image: its build failed on the newly restored 32-bit ARM target.
// 0.8.1 is that same cutover with the 32-bit fix, and was the first published
// Go image. 0.7.40 was the last on Node.
//
// 0.8.10 SORTS AFTER 0.8.2, and the jump is deliberate rather than a typo: these
// are numbers, not decimals, so ten follows two. Docker tags are strings and
// sort lexically, which is why the next one is 0.8.11 and not 0.8.3.
//
// 0.8.11 is the first release a NEW install can complete at all: until it, a
// fresh /data had no `.secret` (so the process exited before serving a page) and
// no database (so the first administrator held no grants). See issue #124.
//
// 0.8.12 finishes that job. 0.8.11 created the files and STILL could not be set
// up: a missing users.json was reported as a read error rather than as "no users
// yet", so `firstRun` never went true and the login page offered a Sign In form
// for an account that could not exist. Same issue, one layer up.
//
// 0.8.13 is the LAST step of that same walk, found by the same reporter getting
// one screen further each time: the wizard worked, and then Add Device did
// nothing, because `#rtrAddBtn` had no listener bound to it anywhere. A new
// install could create its administrator and still not add a router. Three
// releases to make a first run work end to end is worth remembering when the
// next port lands.
//
// 0.8.14 is the one after that, and it stops the walk: a new install now lands
// on the router wizard instead of an empty dashboard. The overlay had existed
// all along and was shown on ONE trigger — the last router being deleted — so it
// could never appear on a first run, which is the only case it is for.
//
// 0.8.15 is the one where the Settings page can save. `#settingsSaveBtn` was
// bound to nothing at all, so no server-side setting could be written from any
// tab — the third control found unwired in a week, after the Add Device button
// and the first-run wizard. `TestInteractiveControlsAreBoundBeyondCaps` is the
// gate that would have caught all three.
//
// 0.8.16 fixes the THIRD instance of one class in a week: a config file that
// does not exist yet reported as a failure. users.json in 0.8.12, routers.json
// in 0.8.14, settings.json here — where it stopped a clean install activating
// its first router. `readIfPresent` is the rule in one place, and
// `TestEveryConfigReaderSurvivesAFreshInstall` is what stops a fourth.
//

//
// ── NOT KNOWING COUNTS AS EXPECTING ONE ────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three answers, and the middle one is why this is not a length check inline at
// the call site:
//
//	routers on file     a device is expected; silence is a fault
//	none, read cleanly  no device is expected; silence is the correct state
//	cannot be read      a device is EXPECTED, because a fleet file that will not
//	                    parse is a real problem and must not be mistaken for a
//	                    fresh install
//
// The third is the one that keeps this honest. `store.Routers` returns no
// routers both when there are none and when the file failed to decode — one
// stray `"disabled": "false"` is enough, as its own comment records — so reading
// the count alone would report a broken install as a brand new one, which is
// exactly the confusion this whole change is about.

// landed, a router nobody is watching is genuinely connected rather than merely
// unknown. Before that this would have read "down" for the whole fleet whenever
// nobody had a browser open, which is exactly the wrong answer for a healthcheck.

	// ── AND THE OVERVIEW POOL, THE THIRD HOLDER ───────────────────────────
	//
	// This asked the two sources it knew about and then gave up, reporting the
	// active router DISCONNECTED whenever the component actually holding it was
	// the third one.
	//
	// That is not a rare state. `warmExclusions` removes from the alert
	// pool every router the overview pool has ANSWERED for — deliberately, so
	// one router is never held by both — and the manager forgets the status
	// of a router it drops. So while anybody has the Devices page open, the
	// manager has no entry for the active router and this returned false for
	// a router that was up and being watched.
	//
	// Worse, it never recovered after a router edit: `routerUpdate` calls
	// `syncPool`, which dials the whole fleet, and nothing schedules a release
	// because nobody was watching the Devices page to stop watching it. Measured
	// against the shipped 0.8.18: `/healthz` went to `ok:false` after one edit
	// and stayed there.
	//
	// `/healthz` answering 503 for a healthy install is not cosmetic — it is how
	// an orchestrator decides to restart the container.
	//
	// KNOWN IS THE GATE, as it is in `warmExclusions` and on the Devices
	// page: a summary exists as soon as `Sync` builds the session, so
	// `Connected: false` is the zero value until the first dial returns. Reading
	// it before then would report a router as down for the second it takes to
	// answer.
