//
// Go sits in front and answers only what it has actually ported; everything
// else is proxied to the Node app untouched. That includes `/socket.io/*`, so
// every unported page keeps working exactly as it does today — which is the
// whole point. Socket.IO is not reimplemented, it is passed through, and it is
// deleted when the last page moves rather than before.
//
// The new frontend is mounted under a PREFIX rather than at `/`. During the
// port both implementations must be reachable in one browser with one session,
// so that a ported page can be compared against the original side by side
// instead of replacing it and hoping. Cookies ignore port numbers, so a login
// taken on the Node port is already valid here.

	// `web/build.mjs` USED TO SAY: "the external stylesheets are NOT copied: the
	// Node app still serves them and the Go server proxies them, so both
	// implementations share one copy rather than drifting apart". Right while
	// Node runs, and fatal when it stops — the ported SPA references EIGHT
	// assets nobody would then serve, so it rendered unstyled with every chart
	// dead. Found by running standalone against the live /data and watching
	// /vendor/tabler.min.css answer 502.
	//
	// **THAT QUOTE WAS SUPERSEDED ON 2026-08-27 and this comment carried it
	// until 2026-08-28.** The assets are now VENDORED into `web/public/`
	// (117 files: `vendor/tabler.min.css`, `vendor/chart.umd.min.js`,
	// `vendor/fonts`, `vendor/world-atlas`, `css/`, `preflight.js`, the login
	// page and the logo), with licences in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md — which had to
	// exist before any of it was committed. build.mjs says so in its own
	// corrected note. The drift the old arrangement guarded against ends at
	// cutover anyway: there is no second implementation to drift from once the
	// JS is removed.
	//
	// So this flag now points at a tree THIS repo owns rather than at Node's.

	// is up and is what coexistence runs on today.

	// It read "Empty means same-origin only, which is what a reverse-proxied
	// deployment wants." That is backwards. A reverse proxy is the one case
	// where the browser's Origin and this process's Host CANNOT match: the
	// browser says `dash.example.com`, the proxy forwards to `10.0.0.5:3081`.
	// So empty is exactly what a proxied deployment does not want, and because
	// the comment said otherwise nothing ever wired a flag to this field —
	// leaving every published Go image unable to open a socket behind a proxy
	// (issue #128, reported against 0.8.20, true since the v0.8.0 cutover).
	//
	// Empty still MEANS same-origin only, and that is still the right default:
	// this check is what stops a hostile page opening an authenticated socket
	// to a MikroDash the victim is signed in to. It is opened deliberately,

	// it": an alias nobody uses is a second code path nobody tests, and this
	// project has already been bitten by exactly that (see `Prefix` in the
