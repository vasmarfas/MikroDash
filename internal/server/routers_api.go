// `src/routers.js:loadAll()` is `if (_cache) return _cache;` — no watcher, no

//
// So a write from HERE is invisible to the running Node app, and is silently
// REVERTED by its next save. That is the settings blocker (`src/settings.js:366`)
// applied to a second file; it was found on 2026-08-26 and is recorded in
// the port record as the fourth cutover blocker.
//
// The routes are complete and tested. What they wait on is CUTOVER, not code.

// ── THE PRIVILEGED-FIELD RULE WAS ALREADY HERE ──────────────────────────────

// `rbac.StripPrivilegedRouterFields` was ported ahead of this route on purpose,
// with its own tests: "a privilege check that has to be REMEMBERED at the call
// site is the kind that gets forgotten". This is the call site it was waiting
// for, and it is the only thing in this file that is not mechanical.
//
// Site membership is an AUTHORIZATION decision, not router config. This route is
// gated on `router:manage` for the TARGET router — which write access to the
// Devices page confers and which is not global-only — so without the strip a
// non-administrator could inject a device into any scope, repeatably and
// invisibly, with every site id enumerable from an ungated `GET /api/sites`.
//
// The fields are DROPPED, not the request refused: the rest of the edit is
// legitimate and the live route applies it.

// its pattern out in full; see the note there.
