package session

// The one place a collector is suspended or resumed by NAME.
//
// ── WHY A TABLE AT ALL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The live session is a JavaScript object, so the supervisor reaches a collector
// as `session[def.sessionProp]` and needs no table. Go's fields are typed and
// unaddressable by string, so the mapping has to exist somewhere; here, once,
// rather than as a `switch` repeated at every call site.
//
// The PAYLOAD side needs no entry per collector — `dormancy_payload.go` reads
// `emptyKey` off the struct by its json tag, so this table carries only what
// cannot be derived: which accessor holds which key.
//
// ── AND WHY EVERY COLLECTOR, NOT JUST THE ELIGIBLE EIGHTEEN ─────────────────
//
// `ResumeCollector` serves the page-focus path for ALL of them. A collector that
// dormancy never judges still has to pass the enabled check, and having one
// funnel for both questions is the point: the live app routes every resume
// through `_resumeCollector` precisely so "a gate that knows nothing about
// dormancy cannot undo it".

// targetKeys names every entry targets() builds.
//
// A LIST BESIDE A TABLE GOES STALE, so it exists only because the coverage gate
// needs the names without constructing a Session — and
// `TestTargetKeysMatchesTheTable` fails the moment the two disagree.

	//	      could call it.

	// `traffic` is the third set B stream and is deliberately NOT here: it
	// already gates itself, per interface, on `Watch`/`Unwatch` refcounts that
	// no room can express. See the note in `collect/traffic.go`.
	//
	// Neither is dormancy-eligible, and both hold their answer through a
	// suspend, so neither needs a `refresh`: the resume IS the re-probe. `logs`
	// re-reads `/log/print` on the way back up and `ping` produces its first
