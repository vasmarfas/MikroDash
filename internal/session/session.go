// charts restart from nothing — the router can be re-read, but the last five
// minutes cannot be re-derived from anything.
//
// So the session outlives its last viewer by `idleGrace`. Return inside that

// and its collectors still warm; stay away and it goes exactly as before.

// that mechanism was never ported. So correcting a router's password did not
// reach the connection that was failing on the old one: the session went on
// dialling the stale credential every five seconds, and the only cure was
// restarting the container or deleting the device.
//
// That mattered most at exactly the wrong moment. Issue #124's credential was
// destroyed by a separate bug in `routerUpdate`; the operator's way out is to
// retype the password — and without this, retyping it changed the file and
// nothing else.

// endpoint and takes the ordinary reconnect path — the same one a router reboot
// produces, which already restarts the streams. Nobody is disconnected and no

// viewers remain. A browser still in the room is told separately
// (`router:disabled`), and its own `releaseRouter` later finds the session gone
// and returns harmlessly.
