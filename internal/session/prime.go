// The one-shot system reading that keeps a Devices card from being blank.
//
// ── LIFTED FROM THE DELETED ALERT POOL'S OWN PRIME, WHICH THIS REPLACES ────
//
// The reasoning is that file's and it survives the move intact, so it is kept
// here rather than summarised: a session held for a non-viewer reason runs only
// what that reason needs (see needs.go), and a WARM session runs nothing at all.
// `Snapshots` can then answer only `Connected`, and the Devices page draws a
// card that knows the router is up and nothing else -- no CPU, no memory, no
// uptime, no model -- for the seconds the overview pool takes to dial its own
// connection.
//
// This closes that the cheapest way there is: ONE read, on a socket that is
// already open, at the moment somebody actually looks at the page. It costs
// nothing while nobody is looking, which is the property the reporting toggle
// exists to protect.
//
// ── THE FILTER MOVED, AND IT IS WIDER THAN THE POOL'S ──────────────────────
//
// The pool filtered on `system == nil`: a pooled session either built the
// collector or did not. A session ALWAYS builds all of them and then suspends
// what it does not need, so the equivalent question is not "is there a
// collector" but "does it hold a reading". That covers one case the pool's
// filter could not express: the connect burst starts every collector before
// `applyReasons` suspends them, so a warm session may well have taken a reading
// on its own -- and when it has, this correctly does nothing.

// primeDeadline bounds how long PrimeStats will hold its caller up.
//
// A read on an open socket comes back in tens of milliseconds; this is the
// allowance for a router that has stopped answering without its connection
// having dropped yet.
//
// ── IT NO LONGER BOUNDS THE READ ITSELF, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ─────────────
//
// It used to: the deadline cancelled the read, which freed the router's
// `roslimit` slot. But go-routeros cancels a command by cancelling the reader
// the whole connection shares, so a prime read slower than this ended the
// connection, and every collector's command with it. A timed-out read now runs
// on to its reply and keeps its slot until then (reader.Do), and `primeStats`
// skips a session whose earlier prime read is still out — so a slow router
// collects one outstanding prime read, not one every two seconds.
const primeDeadline = 1500 * time.Millisecond

// primeReader is the session's `reader` with a deadline stamped on every
// command.
//
// A wrapper rather than a field on `reader`, because the collectors' own reads
// must stay unbounded: they are polls with their own cadence, and a slow one
// blocks nothing but its own loop.
