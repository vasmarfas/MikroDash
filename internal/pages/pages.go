// Package pages is the one list of the app's pages.
//
// ── WHY IT EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A page key was written down in five places: `PAGES` in cmd/webbuild (which
// decides whether a page's markup is composed into the document at all), `PORTED`
// and `PAGE_TITLES` in web/src/main.ts, `PAGE_KEYS` and `ALL_NAV_PAGES` in
// web/src/gen/page-keys.ts, and the web/src/ui/page-<key>.html filenames.
//
// Five copies of one fact is five chances to disagree, and the disagreements are
// quiet ones: a key in the build list but not in PORTED renders an empty shell; a
// key in PORTED but not the build list navigates to markup that is not there.
//
// This is now the source. `cmd/webbuild` reads it to compose the document,
// `internal/server` reads it to register a URL per page, and `cmd/tsgen` emits
// web/src/gen/pages.ts from it — with `-check` in tools/verify.sh failing the
// build when that file goes stale. The TypeScript cannot drift from the Go
// without something red.
//
// ── THE KEY IS THE URL, AND ALSO A ROOM NAME ────────────────────────────────
//
// Each key is three things at once: the page's URL path (`/logs`), the id of its
// markup (`#page-logs`), and the WebSocket room collectors emit to
// (`page-logs`). That is deliberate — one name per page, nothing to map — but it
// means RENAMING A KEY IS A PROTOCOL CHANGE, not a cosmetic one, and both sides
// have to move together.
//
// It also means the keys are a public contract once URLs exist: changing one
// breaks anybody's bookmark.
package pages

// Page is one page of the app.
type Page struct {
	// Key is the URL path, the markup id and the room name. Lower case, and
	// hyphenated where it needs more than one word.
	Key string
	// Title is what the header shows.
	//
	// Every page has one. Three did not until 2026-09-01 and fell through to the
	// raw key, so the header read a lower-case "dashboard" -- inherited from a
	// map that simply had no entry for them.
	Title string
	// Collector is the ONE collector whose data this page exists to show.
	//
	// ── WHY THIS IS DECLARED AND NOT DERIVED ────────────────────────────────
	//
	// It looks derivable: a collector emits to `page-<key>`, so scan the emits.
	// It is not, and the arithmetic says why. There are 26 pages and 27 registry
	// rows; SIX pages have no collector at all (dashboard, reports, audit-trail,
	// backups, devices, settings), FIVE are fed by more than one, and six
	// collector keys differ from the page they own -- `rosusers` owns `users`,
	// `wifi` owns `wifi-networks`, `wireless` owns `wifi-clients`, `conns` owns
	// `connections`, `ifStatus` owns `interfaces`, `topology` owns
	// `network-topology`.
	//
	// So "which collector feeds this page" and "which collector is this page FOR"
	// are different questions, and only the second one is useful. `interfaces` is
	// fed by `ifStatus`; so is `network-topology`, and it is not that page's
	// reason to exist.
	//
	// EMPTY MEANS NO OWNER, and that is a real answer rather than a gap. A page
	// with no owner is one that cannot be emptied by turning a collector off.
	//
	// `internal/verify/ownership_test.go` checks every entry against the registry
	// AND against the emit literals, so a declaration that stops being true fails.
	Collector string
	// Path is the URL segment when it differs from the key. Empty means the key
	// IS the URL, which is true of 25 of the 26 pages.
	//
	// ── THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND WHY IT IS ONE ────────────────────────────────
	//
	// `dashboard` is served at `/home`. The page is called Dashboard everywhere
	// it is named -- in the nav, in its markup id, in its room, in the grants
	// stored in the operator's database -- and only the URL says `home`.
	//
	// This field exists so that ONE difference is declared in one place instead
	// of being a rule the router carries. Adding a second entry is cheap; adding
	// a general key-to-slug mapping was rejected, because a table everything
	// must consult is a table everything can disagree with.
	Path string

// shortcuts address the first nine.

// Renamed maps a page key this app USED to use to the key it uses now.
//
// ── WHY A RENAME NEEDS A TABLE AT ALL ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A page key is also a PERMISSION key, stored in `role_pages.page` in the
// operator's database. Renaming a key therefore orphans every grant naming the
// old one, and an orphaned grant is not an error anywhere: the role simply stops
// conferring that page. Administrators are structural and keep working, so the
// loss is invisible to whoever is most likely to be testing.
//
// That is not hypothetical. On 2026-09-01 this install was found holding grants
// for `topology` and `wireless` -- renamed hours earlier -- so the readonly and
// operator roles had silently lost Network Topology and Wifi Clients. It also
// still held `routers`, dead since the Node cutover, which nobody had noticed in
// the intervening day because nothing looks.
//
// ── RULES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// APPEND-ONLY. An entry is a promise to an installed database, not a note about
// this source, so it outlives everyone's memory of the rename. Removing one
// re-orphans exactly the grants it was added to rescue.
//
// Every value must be a current key and every key must NOT be one, which
// `internal/pages`'s own test asserts in both directions -- so a chain like
// rosusers -> router-users -> users has to be collapsed to its final destination
// rather than left as a hop through a key that no longer exists.
