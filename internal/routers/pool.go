package routers

// The background pool's CONNECTIONS — the half of `src/overviewSessions.js`
// that `overview.go` deliberately left out.
//
// `overview.go` holds the decisions (`SyncPool`, and the per-session lifecycle
// as pure state). This holds the sockets: one connection per router nobody is
// looking at, three collectors on it, and their last payloads cached for
// `BuildRow`.
//
// ── CONSTRUCTED BY NOBODY, ON PURPOSE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// Whether a Go pool may run DURING COEXISTENCE is an operator decision, recorded
// in the port record: Node already runs this pool against the same fleet, so both
// would hold a connection to every router at once. The code is needed under
// every option including "wait for cutover", so it is written and pinned now and
// wired by nothing — the same arrangement as `internal/history.Bucketer`.
//
// ── THREE COLLECTORS, NOT FOURTEEN ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `session.Session` starts fourteen on connect and is a full page-serving
// session; the live overview pool runs system, interfaceStatus and dhcpLeases
// (`overviewSessions.js`). Using `Session` for unwatched routers would be the
// wrong object rather than a heavy version of the right one, and the documented
// bottleneck is concurrent API channels on the MikroTik.
//
// ── THE PER-ROUTER COLLECTION CONFIG (#105) IS HONOURED ─────────────────────
//
// `collection.Resolve` gives this pool the router's effective intervals and its
// enabled set, so a router with `dhcpLeases` turned off does not have it polled
// here either. An earlier version of this file passed `0` for every interval and
// started all three unconditionally, because the port had no `resolveCollection`
// at the time; it does now.
//
// **The live "must not CONSTRUCT a disabled collector" rule does not apply
// here, and that is a property of the port rather than an oversight.** On the
// live side eleven of the sixteen open their streams from a `ros.on('connected')`
// handler in the CONSTRUCTOR, so skipping `start()` is not enough and a null stub
// is needed to keep the shape. The Go collectors are inert until `Start()` —
// verified across system, ifstatus, logs, traffic and dns — so a disabled one is
// simply never started, and no stub exists to drift from the real thing.
//
// `Suspend` and `Resume` still act on all three unconditionally, like the
// original: a stop on a stopped collector is a no-op, and tracking "running"
// only creates a second source of truth that can disagree with the collectors.
//
// ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT OBSERVED HERE ────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ENABLED half is pinned behaviourally: turning `ifStatus` off means
// `/interface/print` never reaches the router, and the mutation that starts it
// anyway dies. Only `ifStatus` of these three is `disableable` — `system` and
// `dhcpLeases` are protected in the registry because other collectors read them
// — so the guards on those two are unreachable BY DESIGN, not by omission.
//
// The INTERVAL half is not observed here, and saying so is more useful than a
// test that looks like it is. Passing `0` instead of `eff.Poll[...]` survives
// every case, because under default settings the resolved interval IS the
// collector's own default and `clampPoll` maps both to the same number. Telling
// them apart needs a non-default interval and a measurement of when the SECOND
// poll happens — a timing test, which is the flakiest kind there is. What the
// numbers are is pinned instead by `internal/collection`'s corpus, which drives
// the live module over 29 cases and kills eight mutations including the clamp
// and the override precedence.
//
// ── EMITS GO NOWHERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The live pool passes a null io whose `to()` is recursively chainable, because
// a collector reaching three rooms threw on a two-level shim. A Go `Emit` is one
// function with no chaining, so the equivalent is simply a function that does
// nothing — the collectors still cache their payloads in `Last()`, which is the
// only thing read here.
//
// ── MUTATIONS (2026-08-25): FIVE KILLED, TWO EQUIVALENT, ONE FOUND A BUG ────
//
//   store the raw reason unclassified   KILLED — and the failure shows
//                                       "/data/secret.key: …" reaching LastError,
//                                       which is the leak the guard exists for.
//   never notice a drop                 KILLED
//   ignore the excluded set             KILLED
//   summaries unsorted                  KILLED
//   make destroy() wait again           KILLED, by HANGING — see `destroy`. The
//                                       hang IS the finding: it deadlocks the
//                                       mid-dial teardown. A hang is a poor kill
//                                       signal, so run with `-timeout`.
//
//   EQUIVALENT — dropping the `Destroyed()` check after the dial. The connection
//   still gets closed: `OnConnected` carries its own destroyed guard (that is
//   what it is for, pinned in `overview_test.go`) so no collector starts, and the
//   already-closed `stop` channel then takes the loop through `teardown`, which
//   closes it. The explicit check closes it SOONER and is defence in depth, not a
//   distinct behaviour. Kept for that reason, recorded rather than counted.
//
//   EQUIVALENT HERE — making Resume start collectors on a DEAD session. The guard
//   is `OverviewSession.Resume()`'s, pinned by `overview_test.go`; from outside
//   this package "a collector was started against a dead connection" is not
//   observable, and its only effect is a poll that reads `errNotConnected`.
//   Duplicating that assertion here would test the same line twice.

// ── WHY SUSPENDING IS NOT ENOUGH ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `Suspend` stops collecting and KEEPS the sockets, deliberately, so returning
// to the Devices page is instant. The cost of that was invisible and fleet-wide:
// `syncFleetHolds` excludes every router this pool lists in `Summaries()`, and a
// suspended session is still listed -- so once anybody opened Devices, the
// overview pool owned the whole fleet, stopped collecting the moment they left,
// and the warm holds were locked out of all of it.
//
// The result was no alert evaluation and no continuous history for ANY router
// until something else happened to re-run `syncFleetHolds`. That contradicts the
// reason the warm hold exists, which `server.go` states plainly: a router
// nobody is watching "is still known to be up and still has its alerts
// evaluated, which is a claim about the whole uptime of the process".
//
// So leaving the page now RELEASES the routers rather than merely going quiet on
// them, and the warm holds take them back. Returning to Devices re-dials, which
// is what the first visit does anyway -- a cost paid by the person looking at
// the page, instead of a gap in coverage paid by everyone who is not.

// Drop tears down ONE router's background session and leaves the rest alone.
//
// ── WHY THIS EXISTS RATHER THAN A Sync CALL ─────────────────────────────────
//
// It is the imperative form of Sync's own rule that a router which is both
// tracked and excluded gets stopped. A browser has just selected this router, an
// interactive Session is dialling it, and the socket this pool has held since
// the Devices page was last open is now a SECOND connection to one device --
// `Suspend` keeps its sockets deliberately, so navigating away does not release
// it and nothing re-syncs until a router edit or a return to Devices.
//
// **NOT `Sync`.** `SyncPool` computes Start as "every router that is neither
// excluded nor already tracked" (overview.go:69-74), so calling it from a socket
// handler on a pool that has never run -- `p.sessions` empty, so `tracked` empty
// -- would START a background session for the entire fleet and dial every
// router. That is the opposite of the fix, and it is the obvious wrong turn
// here, which is why this method exists to make the right one easy.
//
// Membership is not tracked twice: the next `Sync` re-derives it from the store
// and the live-session set, and re-adds this router once its Session has gone.

// Tracked reports which routers the pool currently holds a session for.
// Suspended reports whether the pool is holding its collectors stopped.
//
// `OverviewSession` already exposes the same fact per session; this is the
// fleet-wide one. It exists because the CALLER decides when to suspend — on the
// last watcher leaving the Devices page — and a caller that gets that wrong
// holds a connection to every router for a page nobody has open, which is
// silent, indefinite, and exactly what the design is meant to prevent.
