//
// Fifteen is where the Node app's migrations end, and the DDL is their final
// shape rather than a replay of them. Everything above it is a migration this
// port owns and applies itself, from `portMigrations` — the Node app is gone, so
// "Node owns migrations" stopped being a reason and became a reason nothing
// could ever be added.
//
// Stamping anything lower would make `Open` refuse the database it had just
// written; stamping higher than the migrations listed would claim ones that
// never ran.
const schemaVersion = 16

// portMigrations are the schema steps this port owns, keyed by the version they
// take a database TO.
//
// ── EVERY STATEMENT MUST BE SAFE TO RUN TWICE ───────────────────────────────
//
// The version row is what normally stops a replay, but a database that was
// created by `freshSchemaDDL` already HAS everything here and is stamped at the
// current version, so the two paths must agree. `IF NOT EXISTS` makes them
// agree without the two lists having to be compared.
//
// ── AND THEY RUN FROM cmd/mikrodash, NOT FROM Open ──────────────────────────
//
// `cmd/compat` opens a production /data through a READ-ONLY mount to prove this
// build can still read it. A migration inside `Open` would fail on the one tool
// whose job is to touch nothing. Same placement, and the same reason, as
// `RenamePageGrants`.

// as it goes, and `MAX(version)` is what reads it back. A fresh database has run
// none of them, but it HAS arrived at the state they produce, so recording only
// v15 would let a future migration runner believe 1..14 are outstanding and
// replay them against tables that already exist.
//
// ── AND IT IS ALL ONE TRANSACTION ──────────────────────────────────────────

// this path for ever, and then fail on whichever table did not get made. On any
// error the file is removed, so the next start tries again from nothing.
