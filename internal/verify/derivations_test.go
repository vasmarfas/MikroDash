// TestEveryCollectorDeclaresItsDerivation is the ledger for phase 4.1 of
// Collectors-Rewrite.md: turning each collector's "rows in, payload out" half
// into a function with no receiver and no I/O.
//
// ── WHY A LEDGER, WHEN THE WORK IS JUST REFACTORING ─────────────────────────
//
// Because the scope was mis-measured twice in one afternoon, in both directions.
// A grep for `Build*` said seventeen collectors had no derivation; several of
// them had one called `Parse*` instead. An estimate is not a measurement, and
// this phase is long enough that a wrong one changes what gets built.
//
// It also does the thing every other ledger here does: it shrinks. A phase whose
// remaining work is visible in a test cannot quietly stall, and a collector added
// later cannot join without answering the question.
//
// ── WHAT COUNTS AS EXTRACTED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A package-level function, named here, that the collector's file declares. This
// gate checks the NAME EXISTS AND IS PACKAGE-LEVEL -- it cannot prove a function
// is pure, and says so rather than implying otherwise. What it does prove is that
// the derivation has a name a test can call without building a collector, which
// is the property 4.1 is actually for.
//
// PRIOR STATE AS A PARAMETER is the established shape, not a new invention:
// `BuildBandwidth(prev, in)`, `BuildQueueRows(rows, prev, now)` and
// `BuildIfStatus(prev, in)` all take it as an argument. About a third of these
// collectors carry something between ticks, and a derivation holding that on a
// receiver is not extracted, whatever it is called.
