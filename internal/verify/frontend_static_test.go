// ── THE SHAPE THAT SHIPPED TWICE IN ONE WEEK ────────────────────────────────
//
// `caps.ts` looks up a control to enable, disable or hide it. That reference
// makes the id look bound to any check that asks "is this id named anywhere",
// which is why `TestTemplateIDsAreBound` never saw either of these:
//
//	rtrAddBtn         Add Device rendered, enabled, no listener. A new install
//	                  could create an account and then not add a router at all.
//	settingsSaveBtn   Save Settings rendered, enabled, no listener. NO
//	                  server-side setting could be saved from any tab.
//
// Both were found by a person clicking, months apart, and both were reported as
// something else — "cannot add any device", "Appearance Save not working". The
// wiring audit that would have caught them read the deleted Node source and was
// retired with it.
//
// ── WHY BUTTONS, AND WHY THIS RULE AND NOT A STRICTER ONE ───────────────────
//
// Measured against the tree when this was written: 92 buttons with ids, 91
// referenced from a feature module, exactly one — `settingsSaveBtn` — from
// `caps.ts` alone. Zero false positives, and it catches both known instances.
//
// Two stricter rules were measured and rejected. Requiring every id in the
// markup to be bound gives 240 failures, nearly all labels and layout wrappers:
// a ledger that size is one nobody reads. Requiring an `addEventListener` near
// the id gives 23, of which 22 are legitimate table-driven or delegated wiring —
// a 96% false-positive rate.
//
// Inputs and selects are deliberately out of scope: the ~78 `s_*` fields are
// bound generically through `el('s_' + key)`, which `templateIDsUnbound` already
// records under the `s_` prefix.
