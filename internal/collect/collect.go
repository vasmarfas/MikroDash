// strings, and the Node collectors run them through JavaScript's implicit
// conversions; a Go port that reaches for strconv directly gets a payload that
// is right nearly everywhere and wrong at the edges — and the edges are exactly
// where a router with an unusual build lands. Number("") is 0, Number(undefined)
// is NaN, and the difference decides whether a gauge reads zero or renders as
// "not reported". Both cases are reproduced here on purpose.

// it.
//
// Three collectors (`packages`, `routing`, `talkers`) have NO mutex at all.

// already picked up by the NEXT tick without any help. What it does not do is
// affect the timer already running — and that is the whole point of a settings
// save: an operator moving a poll from sixty seconds to five expects five, not
// to wait out the remaining fifty-nine first.
//
// ── AND WHY IT MEASURES FROM NOW, WHERE `start` MEASURES FROM `lastRun` ─────
//
// `start` deliberately counts the elapsed time since the last run, because page
// navigation calls stop/start freely and firing unconditionally would let a user
// generate one request per visit at a router poll mode exists to be gentle on.
//
// This is a different event with a different answer. The live side does
// `clearInterval(col.timer); col.timer = setInterval(run, ...)`, which schedules
// a FULL new interval from the moment of the save — so shortening an interval
// does not fire an immediate extra poll, and lengthening one does not leave a
// timer running to an instant the operator has just replaced. Reproduced rather
// than improved: measuring from `lastRun` would poll IMMEDIATELY whenever the
// new interval is shorter than the time already elapsed, which is exactly the
// burst a settings save across a fleet must not produce.
//
// A stopped loop is left alone: `start` will compute a fresh delay when the page
// is next opened, and re-arming a timer for a collector nobody is watching would
// undo what `stop` is for.

// ── PHASE 4.1: THE IN-PROCESS EDGES, DECLARED ───────────────────────────────
//
// Fourteen collectors read another collector's output in memory. That is not
// debt -- it is the shared-derivation structure the three-layer split is for,
// and phase 2 was skipped partly because deleting it would have been wrong.
//
// What was wrong was how it was SPELLED. A consumer held a pointer to the
// PRODUCER -- `*DHCPLeases`, `*System` -- so the edge said "I need the leases
// collector" when what it means is "I need the lease payload". The difference is
// not cosmetic:
//
//	the consumer cannot be tested without building the whole producer
//	the edge is invisible from the consumer's own type, and lives only in
//	  `internal/verify/collectoredges_test.go`, read out of session.go
//	swapping where a derivation comes from means changing every consumer
//
// Four consumers already had it right -- `RateSource`, `LeaseIPs`,
// `FilterRowSource`, `LeaseCounts` all name a CAPABILITY. These three complete
// the set, and every one of the seven remaining call sites used exactly one
// method: `Last()`.
//
// NIL IS ALWAYS ALLOWED, and that is the existing convention rather than a new
// one: a collector the operator has disabled is absent, and a consumer costs
// exactly the field that edge fed. See each consumer's own note.
//
// ── AND NIL MEANS AN UNTYPED NIL, WHICH IS A REAL TRAP HERE ────────────────
//
// A caller holding a `*DHCPLeases` that happens to be nil and passing it as a
// `LeaseSource` produces an interface that is NOT nil: it carries the type. Every
// `if x == nil` guard in the consumers would then be false, and the first call
// would dereference a nil receiver.
//
// It cannot happen from `internal/session`, which constructs every collector
// before wiring any of them, and a caller passing a literal `nil` is fine
// because that is an untyped nil. It is written down because the failure is a
// panic in a collector that has a nil check right there and looks correct, and
// because this is exactly the moment the hazard was introduced: the fields were
// concrete pointers until now, where a nil pointer really was nil.

// LeaseSource supplies the current DHCP lease table. Consumed by `bandwidth`,
// `connections`, `wireless` and `topology`, each to put a NAME on an address.

// from. Consumed by `bandwidth` and `connections` to tell local traffic from

// ── A FUNCTION, NOT A DATABASE HANDLE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// A collector has no router id and no `*db.DB`, and giving it either would mean
// every fixture harness constructing one. `internal/session` binds the id and
// the store into a closure at build time, exactly as it does for the identity
// writer. NIL IS THE NORMAL CASE — every test constructs collectors without one
// — and nil means "the operator has declared nothing", which is a real answer
// rather than an error.
