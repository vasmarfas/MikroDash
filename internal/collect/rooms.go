package collect

// Where every collector's payload goes, declared once.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A collector's audience was written down twice: as the first argument to its
// `emit`, and again by hand in `internal/server/ws.go`, where `pageBlur` decides
// whether anybody is still watching before it suspends the collector.
//
// Two statements of one fact, and they have disagreed FIVE times — dhcpNetworks,
// bandwidth, vpn, firewall, and routing on 2026-08-31. Each time the symptom was
// the same and silent: a dashboard card stopped updating for anybody who had
// visited the owning page and left, because the blur suspended a collector that
// was still feeding a card the guard did not know about.
//
// This is phase 4.2's core, reduced to the part that was actually buying
// something. A view declares its rooms; everything else reads the declaration.
//
// ── THE PRECEDENT WAS ALREADY HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `logs` and `talkers` already emitted to a named constant rather than a
// literal, and the verify gates already carried an exemption for it. So this is
// the existing pattern applied to the other twenty-three, not a new one.
//
// ── ROOMS ARE PER-EVENT, NOT PER-COLLECTOR ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Two collectors emit to different audiences for different events, and flattening
// that would be wrong rather than untidy:
//
//	conns     `conn:update` reaches the page AND the dashboard card; the two
//	          detail events reach only the page, because only the page renders them.
//	ifStatus  its payload reaches three rooms; `ifstatus:names` is router-wide.
//
// So each set is named for what it is. `Union` is what the blur guard wants —
// everything this collector feeds — and it is derived rather than declared, so
// it cannot disagree with the parts.

import "strings"

// Rooms is one audience. The zero value is the ROUTER-WIDE room: every viewer of
// this router, whatever page they are on.
//
// It is a named type rather than a bare []string so that `Join` lives with it and
// nobody re-invents the comma.

//

// it, so guarding on it would mean never suspending at all. `dhcpNetworks` is the
// case that proves it and `ws.go` carries the reasoning at its call site.

// emit to it (`system`, `dhcpLeases`, and `traffic`'s health and WAN chips) and
// two more do so alongside a page room; none of that is guardable.

// — which suspends. `internal/verify` asserts every disableable collector has an
// entry, so nil means a collector that was never meant to be guarded.

// keepAliveFor is rooms where a collector must keep RUNNING for another
// collector's sake, and which are not part of its own audience.
//
// ── IT EMPTIED ONCE, AND THAT IS WHY THE MECHANISM STAYED ──────────────────
//
// The first entry was `conns`, which emits to the Connections page and its
// dashboard card and to nothing else -- but `bandwidth` read the connection
// table it deposited in `ConnTable`, so suspending `conns` while somebody was on
// the BANDWIDTH page starved a page `conns` never sends to. Modelling that as an
// audience would have been wrong: nothing is ever emitted there.
//
// `ConnTable` is gone. Both collectors SUBSCRIBE to
// `/ip/firewall/connection/print` now, so `bandwidth` holds its own demand on
// the menu and a suspended `conns` starves nothing.
// `TestBothConnectionConsumersShareOneRead` is the proof -- it stops
// `connections` and asserts the menu still has a subscriber.
//
// The map was kept empty rather than deleted, on the grounds that "the next
// cross-collector dependency will need it". Phase 4.2b is that next one, and it
// arrived four days later.
//
// ── `ifStatus` IS THE ENTRY, AND DEMAND IS WHAT MADE IT NECESSARY ──────────
//
// Under the page switchboard `ifStatus` was never gated at all: it ran from
// connect to teardown, and `resumePage` said so out loud --
//
//	interfaceStatus is NOT suspended on blur — three other collectors take it
//	as their rate source, and a bridges viewer who never opens Interfaces would
//	otherwise see every throughput column go blank.
//
// Demand gates every collector on its rooms, so that sentence stops being a
// comment and becomes a bug: `ifStatus` emits to Interfaces, Network Topology
// and the Physical Ports card, and it would suspend for a viewer sitting on
// Bridges. Its `Rates()` returns an availability flag and the payload renders
// null rather than breaking, so the failure is not a crash -- it is every
// throughput column on four pages quietly reading "—".
//
// FIVE CONSUMERS take it as their `RateSource`, built in session.go: bridges,
// vlans, wan, topology and bandwidth. Topology already shares a room with it, so
// the rooms named here are the other four.
//
// This is a DEPENDENCY, not an audience, and the distinction is the whole reason
// this map is separate from `RoomsOf`: nothing is ever emitted to these rooms by
// `ifStatus`, and `RoomsOf` must keep meaning "who receives this collector's
// payload" for the emit-side gates that read it.
//
// ── `dhcpLeases` IS THE OTHER ONE, AND IT HAS NO AUDIENCE AT ALL ───────────
//
// It emits ROUTER-WIDE — `EvLeasesList.Emit(d.emit, "", …)` — because the live app
// does, and because two consumers live outside the DHCP page: the Connections
// page names a device by its IP from the lease table, and four collectors read
// the leases in process. A router-wide emit is not a room, so `RoomsOf` returns
// nothing for it and demand would suspend it the moment the switchboard stopped
// resuming it by name. The DHCP page would then sit on "Waiting for lease
// data…", and every connection would render as a bare address.
//
// The rooms named are its real consumers: the DHCP page (through `dhcpNetworks`,
// which shares it), and the four collectors that take it as a source — conns,
// wireless, topology and bandwidth, wired in session.go.

	//
	// It emits nothing. Its whole output is an in-memory IP<->MAC index that
	// four collectors read, so the rooms that should keep it running are THEIRS:
	// the Connections and Bandwidth pages ask it IP→MAC to reach a lease, and
	// WiFi Clients and Network Topology ask it MAC→IP for an address their own

//
// ── A SWITCH CANNOT BE ENUMERATED, AND SOMETHING HAS TO ────────────────────
//
// `RoomsOf` is a switch, so nothing outside it can ask "which collectors have an
// audience at all". `internal/session` needs exactly that: a collector that
// declares rooms and is missing from the dormancy target table is one demand
// never asks about, and it would never start for a viewer — silently, because a
// collector that is never resumed looks like one with nothing to report.
//
// A LIST BESIDE A SWITCH GOES STALE, which is why `rooms_test.go` keeps its own
// copy and `TestDeclaredRoomKeysMatchesTheSwitch` fails the moment the two
// disagree. That is the same arrangement `session.targetKeys` has with
// `session.targets()`, and for the same reason.
