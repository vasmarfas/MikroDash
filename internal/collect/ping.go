//	/tool/ping   streamed with interval=N, one !re per result
//
// ── LOSS IS A ROLLING WINDOW, NOT A RATIO OF EVERYTHING ─────────────────────
//
// Ten results wide. That is what stops a single timeout jumping the card to
// 100% and a single reply dropping it straight back to 0% — the number a viewer
// watches is "how bad is it right now", and a lifetime average answers a
// different question badly.
//
// ── WHAT COUNTS AS A REPLY IS NARROWER THAN IT LOOKS ────────────────────────
//
// `replied` is "no status, or exactly `replied`". RouterOS also answers
// `echo reply` — the documentation shows it for a multicast ping — and that
// string is NOT `replied`, so it counts as LOST. Reproduced rather than
// widened: the live card has always counted it that way, and a port that
// quietly accepted it would show a different loss figure than the app it
// replaces. Recorded here because no fixture will ever contain it: it needs a
// multicast target.
//
// ── AND A DURATION CAN CARRY TWO UNITS ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The docs show `max-rtt=1ms438us`. The original's regex takes the FIRST number
// and the FIRST unit, so `1ms438us` parses as 1 and the 438µs is dropped. Also
// reproduced. A tidier parser would report 1.438 and disagree with the live
// card on every sub-millisecond hop.
//
// ── PERMISSION DENIED LATCHES ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `/tool/ping` needs the `test` policy. Without it every retry fails the same
// way, so the refusal is recorded once, emitted so the card can say so, and not
// retried until the router reconnects.

// exactly what the live route does — `s.ping.pollMs = ...; s.ping._restartStream()`

// A stopped stream stays stopped: `stopStream` is a no-op when there is none,
// and `startStream` returns early if the client is not connected or the menu was
// denied. Both matter, because a settings save re-tunes every collector
// including ones nobody is watching.
// SetTarget points ping at a different host while it runs.
//
// ── WHY A RUNNING PING NEEDS THIS ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The router form edits `pingTarget`, and a Dashboard session is held for as
// long as its router has alerting or recording on — the hAP AX3's, for good —
// so a target read only when the session was built would never change on it.
//
// THE HISTORY GOES WITH THE OLD HOST. Its readings are not the new host's, and
// keeping them would chart one host's latency and loss under another's name.
// An empty target means the default, as NewPing's does.
