package collect

// Wifi collector — whichever wireless stack this router has, plus what a legacy
// CAPsMAN manager presents on top of it.
//
// A router runs EITHER `/interface/wifi` (modern) or `/interface/wireless`
// (legacy), never both, and which one is not knowable without asking. The stack
// is probed once and latched, and RESET on reconnect, because a package can be
// installed and the router rebooted underneath us.
//
// `/caps-man` is a THIRD source and not a third stack: its interfaces are remote
// CAPs' radios, presented on the manager, and they appear in neither local menu.
// A manager showed a page listing none of them until 2026-09-13. See
// readLegacyCaps, and BuildCapsLegacyNetworks next door.
//
// ── WHAT IS ABSENT FROM EVERY PROPLIST IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY ─────────────
//
// `security.passphrase`, `wpa-pre-shared-key` and `wpa2-pre-shared-key` appear
// in none of them. Adding a field here puts it in front of every browser
// holding read on this page. The profile menus are shared with the CAPsMAN
// collector for the same reason: one definition of the safe proplist, so the two
// callers cannot drift apart.
//
// The view builders and their helpers live in wifiview.go — pure, and gated by
// a generator rather than a fixture, because no router here runs the legacy
// stack. See that file's header.

	// with no proplist at all. So nothing here reads `master` any more —
