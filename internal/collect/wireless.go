// ── THE VALUE IS NOT A SUFFIX, WHICH IS THE TRAP ────────────────────────────
//
// The obvious reading — take everything after the dash — is wrong twice over,
// and both forms are real. Checked against MikroTik's documentation rather than
// against the one router to hand, because a fixture proves what one radio
// answered and the docs say what a radio MAY answer:
//
//	modern (/interface/wifi/channel band):
//	  2ghz-g 2ghz-n 2ghz-ax 2ghz-be 5ghz-a 5ghz-ac 5ghz-an 5ghz-ax
//	  5ghz-be 6ghz-ax 6ghz-be
//	legacy (/interface/wireless):
//	  2ghz-b/g/n, 5ghz-a/n/ac, 2ghz-onlyn, 5ghz-onlyac
//
// So `5ghz-an` is ONE token meaning a/n, and `5ghz-a/n/ac` is THREE. A suffix
// test also fails on the pair it matters most for: "an" ends in "n" and would
// read as plain 802.11n, which is the same answer by luck, while "be" and "ac"
// share no letters with anything and would be fine. Luck is not a reason.
//
// THE HIGHEST TOKEN WINS. A slash list is what the radio offers, and a client in
// it negotiated the best both ends support — reporting the lowest would label a
// Wi-Fi 5 client as Wi-Fi 4 on every legacy AP.
//
// An empty result is normal and must stay renderable: a CAPsMAN row carries no
// band at all, which is why wlBandOf falls back to the interface name.
