// testdata/fixtures/ holds what a live router SAID; testdata/golden/ holds what
// the Node collector MADE of it (tools/make-golden.js). This replays the first

// whole reason the fixture corpus was captured before any Go was written: the
// port is not asked to be plausible, it is asked to be identical.
//
// GAPS ARE LISTED, NOT SKIPPED SILENTLY. Every golden without a Go collector is
// reported by name, and the count is asserted, so "we have ported one of
// sixteen" is visible in the test output rather than inferred from its absence.
//
// Wall-clock fields are excluded on both sides — `ts`, taken at emit, and
// `deltaWindowMs`, the measured gap between two metadata commits. Neither can
// come from a fixture, and `deltaWindowMs` was seen flipping between 320 and 321
// on consecutive regenerations, which would make this gate intermittent.

//
// ── WHY A LEDGER AND NOT A REGENERATED GOLDEN ───────────────────────────────
//
// The goldens cannot be regenerated: `tools/make-golden.js` read the Node source
// and that source is gone, so the run skips. Hand-editing one is worse than
// useless — CLAUDE.md's rule is that a hand-copied table "is a fork with no
// update path" — and deleting the gate to make an addition quiet is the one
// thing this repository has explicitly lost coverage to before.
//
// So an addition is RECORDED. The field is stripped from the Go payload before
// the diff, and everything else still has to match the Node recording exactly.
//
// ── AND IT FAILS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// An unrecorded addition fails the diff, and a recorded one that has STOPPED
// being produced fails here — otherwise this list becomes folklore: a set of
// excuses for differences nobody re-measures, outliving the changes it
// describes. That is the rule the surviving ledgers in internal/verify carry and
// it is the reason this one is safe to add.
//
// Paths are `field`, `list[].field`, or either with a dotted prefix naming the
// objects to descend through first — `profiles.channel[].legacy`. The prefix
// arrived with the legacy CAPsMAN rows, which sit two levels down; a flat name
// resolved to nothing and the strip silently did nothing, which is the direction
// that looks like a pass.
