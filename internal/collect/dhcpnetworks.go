//	/ip/dhcp-server/network/print           the subnets, their gateway and DNS
//	/ip/address/print                       which address sits on which interface
//	/ip/pool/print                          the ranges each pool hands out

//
// ── POOLS ARE MATCHED TO SUBNETS BY ADDRESS, NOT BY CONFIGURATION ────────────
//
// A pool is joined to a subnet by asking whether its FIRST address falls inside
// that subnet's CIDR. The Node comment says why: it is more reliable than
// chasing the server → interface → address chain, which breaks whenever a
// server names an interface carrying more than one address. Reproduced as-is,
// including that a pool spanning two subnets counts against the one its first
// address lands in.
//
// ── THE 32-BIT FOLD IS DELIBERATE ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// poolRangeSize turns an address into a number with
// `bytes.reduce((acc, b) => (acc << 8) + b, 0) >>> 0`. In JavaScript `<<` works
// on int32 and `>>> 0` reads the result back as uint32, so the whole fold is
// arithmetic modulo 2^32 — which is exactly what Go's uint32 does, for any
// length of input. Writing it as uint32 therefore reproduces the original
// INCLUDING its overflow, rather than reproducing what it was probably meant to
// do. That matters for an IPv6 range, where both sides fold sixteen bytes into
// thirty-two bits and get the same wrong answer; a "corrected" Go version would
// disagree with the payload the page has always been given.
