// NetWatch collector — the port of src/collectors/netwatch.js.
//
//	/tool/netwatch   the monitored hosts and whether each is up
//
// ── THIS HAS NO PAGE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It emits to `page-dashboard`, not to a page of its own: NetWatch is a card on
// the Dashboard, and `public/index.html` has no `page-netwatch` at all. So this
// queue item is the collector, and the card that renders the payload arrives
// with the Dashboard.
//
// ── EVENT-DRIVEN OVER THERE, POLLED HERE ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The original prefers `/tool/netwatch/listen`, which pushes a state change the
// moment it happens, and keeps a 60-second heartbeat so the browser's staleness
// timer never fires while nothing is changing. This side polls. The parsing is
// the same code either way — `_loadInitial` there, Tick here — so adding the
// stream later changes delivery and not the payload.
//
// ── A RENAME DOES NOT REACH THE BROWSER ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// The emit fingerprint is `id:status` per host and nothing else, so renaming a
// NetWatch entry produces no update until its state next changes. That is the
// live behaviour, reproduced deliberately: the card exists to show what is up
// and what is down, and re-emitting the whole table on a cosmetic edit is what
// the fingerprint is there to prevent.

	// With a cache this collector does not decide when to read. It SUBSCRIBES to
	// its menu at a cadence and the router's one scheduler decides, which is what
	// gives "should this run" a single answer instead of five.
	//
	// THE POLL LOOP STAYS AS THE FALLBACK, and that is transitional rather than
	// tidy. Both background pools build this collector with no cache -- a router
	// nobody is watching still needs netwatch for its alerts -- so `cache == nil`
	// has to keep working exactly as before. Same rule as `readVia`: nil falls
	// through to the old path and nothing else changes.
	// See scheduled.go: one menu, subscribed at a cadence, with the poll loop
	// above as the no-cache fallback.
