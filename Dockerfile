# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
#
# MikroDash — the Go + TypeScript port, as a self-contained image.
#
# Built after cutover (2026-08-30), when the app was still being served by
# mounting the repo into `golang:1.25-alpine` and running the binary from it.
# That works and is exactly how the port was developed, but it is not a
# deployment artifact: it depends on the repo staying at one path on one host,
# and on a toolchain image that has no business being in production.

# ── the frontend ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# ── NO NODE STAGE ANY MORE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This was `FROM node:22-alpine`, `npm ci`, `npm run build` — 142 lines of Node
# driving esbuild, which is itself a Go program. `cmd/webbuild` does the same
# work from the Go stage below, and its output is BYTE-IDENTICAL: verified file
# by file against the Node build before the stage was removed.
#
# What this buys is not speed. It is that the image no longer pulls a second
# language runtime, and a contributor can produce a correct build with the Go
# toolchain alone. `tsc --noEmit` still needs Node and still lives in
# `web/package.json` — but a typecheck EMITS NOTHING, so it gates a change
# without being needed to make one.

# ── the geo database ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# DB-IP City Lite, fetched fresh at build. This replaced copying geoip-lite's
# `.dat` files out of the Node app's image, which tied the build to that image
# AND shipped whatever data geoip-lite 2.0.3 happened to publish — neither its
# Dockerfile nor its CI ever ran `updatedb`, so the addresses moved and the file
# did not.
#
# DB-IP is a direct download: no account, no licence key, no EULA. MaxMind
# GeoLite2 is more accurate and updates twice weekly, but needs a key that
# expires every 90 days, which would make this a build nobody else can run.
#
# THE MONTH IS TRIED, THEN THE ONE BEFORE. DB-IP publishes monthly and the new
# file appears partway through the first day; a build at 00:30 on the 1st would
# otherwise fail for a reason that has nothing to do with the build.
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM: an .mmdb is the same file on every architecture,
# so downloading it once natively beats downloading it three times, twice
# under emulation.

# ── the binary ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# CGO_ENABLED=0 is not decoration. `modernc.org/sqlite` is pure Go precisely so
# this binary needs no libc at runtime, which is what lets the final stage be a
# base image rather than a distro.
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM PINS THE TOOLCHAIN TO THE NATIVE BUILDER, and that is
# the single biggest thing keeping this build fast.
#
# Without it, buildx runs this whole stage once per target architecture, and two
# of the three under QEMU emulation. Measured on the v0.8.1 release build: 18m34s
# for three architectures, with the emulated arm/v7 `go build` alone taking over
# 280 seconds and `geogen` -- which walks ~14.7M networks -- far longer.
#
# Go cross-compiles from a single native toolchain, and CGO_ENABLED=0 means there
# is no C toolchain to arrange, so emulating anything here buys nothing. The
# binary is the ONLY per-architecture artefact; everything else this stage
# produces is identical across all three.
FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.25-alpine AS build
