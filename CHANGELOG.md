# Changelog

All notable changes to MikroDash will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.53] - Saving settings no longer crashes, and a slow router stops dropping its connection

A fixes release on top of 0.8.52, including a contributed fix for settings saves.

### Fixed

- **A slow RouterOS command no longer disconnects the router.** One command that
  took longer than its timeout used to end the whole connection, so routers
  dropped and reconnected, often right after MikroDash started.
- **The orange "RouterOS not connected" banner only shows for the router you are
  viewing.** Another router dropping lit it over a healthy one.
- **The Dashboard's Networks card no longer goes stale minutes after loading.**
  A ping stream that ended quietly is now reopened.
- **Each router pings its own ping target.** Every router pinged the default
  `1.1.1.1` whatever its device settings said. Editing the target takes effect
  without reconnecting, so latency on the Dashboard and in Reports now measures
  the target you set.
- **A disconnect in the log says why.** It reads whether the router ended the
  session, with the router's reason, or the connection was lost on the way.
- **The Dashboard asks for less when it loads.** Each card subscribes once
  instead of three times, and nothing is requested before a router is selected.
- **An idle collector on the router you are viewing stays asleep.** It woke
  itself every couple of minutes to read a menu the router does not have.

### Merged contributions

Thanks to [@omegaatt36](https://github.com/omegaatt36).

- **Saving settings no longer crashes** ([#133](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/pull/133)).
  Since 0.8.0 the first settings save after startup failed in the Docker image,
  and poll interval changes then stopped applying until a restart.

### Internal

- New tests pin that a timed-out command leaves the connection up and holds its
  router slot until the router answers, and that the poll map works outside the
  source tree.

## [0.8.52] - The update dialog closes itself, and quiet routers stop looking stale

A fixes release on top of 0.8.51.

### Fixed

- **The Update RouterOS dialog closes itself when the router is back.** It used
  to sit on "Rebooting…" after the router had restarted and MikroDash had
  reconnected. It now closes once the router has been reachable again for three
  seconds, so a router that blips back briefly before its real reboot does not
  close it early.
- **Settings → Devices shows each router's current RouterOS version.** The
  Version column (and Model and Serial with it) stopped updating, so a router you
  had upgraded kept showing its old version. It now updates as soon as MikroDash
  reads the router.
- **Top Talkers no longer goes stale on a quiet router.** On a router with little
  or no traffic the card was marked stale even though the router was answering
  fine.
- **Add Card on the Dashboard places new cards properly.** It dropped every added
  card on top of an existing one. The grid now grows downward to make room.
- **The API Diagnostics card works.** It was always empty. It now shows how much
  MikroDash asks each router for, without asking the router for anything extra.
- **"Clear all" on the alert bell records when the alerts were cleared.** It used
  the browser's clock instead of the time MikroDash recorded.

### Internal

- Every WebSocket message is declared once in Go with its payload type, and the
  browser's types are generated from those declarations, so the two sides cannot
  drift apart without the build failing. A test holds that Go never sends a null
  array to the browser.
- Listeners for two alert events that nothing ever sent are removed, along with
  other reads of fields the server never sends.
- CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and Collector-Architecture.md describe the Go and
  TypeScript app as it is; two finished planning documents are removed.

## [0.8.51] - The update check on the dashboard could get stuck

A one-fix release on top of 0.8.50.

### Fixed

- **The dashboard's System card could sit on "Finding out latest version…" for
  ever.** That is RouterOS still asking MikroTik, not an answer, and MikroDash was
  meant to come back and look again a minute later. It never did: the retry it
  scheduled had no caller. Whether you saw it depended only on whether your
  router's check had finished by the time MikroDash read the result, which is why
  it hit some devices and not others. Present in 0.8.50.

## [0.8.50] - The collector rewrite: MikroDash asks your routers a lot less

This release rebuilds how MikroDash gets data out of your routers. Nothing about
the pages changes, but almost everything behind them does, and the result is a
dashboard that is lighter on your hardware and quicker to fill in.

**Why it mattered.** MikroDash used to have every collector run its own timer and
ask the router for whatever it needed, whenever it felt like it. Two collectors
that wanted the same table asked twice. A page you were not looking at kept
asking anyway. A router nobody had open still ran the full set. RouterOS limits
how many things can talk to it at once, so all of that competed for the same
narrow pipe, and on a busy device it showed as pages that filled slowly.

**What it does now.** Collectors say what they need rather than going and getting
it. One reader per router works out what is due, asks once, and hands the answer
to everyone who wanted it. Where RouterOS can push updates instead of being
polled, it does. And nothing runs unless something is actually watching it.

**Measured on a four router fleet, sitting idle: 270 commands a minute down to
81.** The router being viewed went from 95 to 47.

### Added

- **Device names and IP addresses in more places.** MikroDash now reads the ARP
  table, which is what connects an IP address to a device. WiFi Clients shows each
  client's address; Connections can name a device whose DHCP lease is filed under
  a different address, and shows its MAC either way; Network Topology can locate
  a neighbour that does not announce an address of its own.
- **Reverse DNS as a last resort for naming.** A device with a fixed address and
  no DHCP lease, typically a printer or a server, is looked up by name and appears
  as that name rather than as a bare MAC.
- **The Stream / Poll switch does something now.** It has been in the device
  dialog since the rewrite and nothing read it. Fourteen menus can now be pushed
  by the router instead of polled, and the switch chooses per device. Both modes
  honour the same interval slider, so choosing Poll never silently means slower.
- **`Collector-Architecture.md`**, a plain description of how the collector layer
  works and why. It is checked by the test suite, so it cannot quietly go out of
  date.

### Changed

- **Collectors stop when nobody is looking.** Close a page and its collector
  stops; open it and it starts. This used to be a hand written list of which page
  meant which collector, and it disagreed with reality five separate times, each
  one a dashboard card that silently stopped updating.
- **Routers you are not viewing cost almost nothing.** A device kept online only
  for alerting runs the handful of collectors the alert rules need, not all of
  them. One kept online only so the Devices page can say "up" runs none at all.
- **Two collectors wanting the same table now cost one read.** Connections and
  Bandwidth share the connection table; Interfaces and the traffic graph share one
  channel where they used to open two.
- **Interface rates are read from a live channel** rather than measured by
  repeatedly asking. That alone removed 52 commands a minute per router.
- **Ping honours the interval you set.** RouterOS silently ignores a ping interval
  above five seconds; a 30 second setting delivered a ping every five. Above five
  seconds MikroDash now polls instead, so the setting means what it says.

### Fixed

- **The Devices page showed no WAN RX/TX.** Three separate causes, including one
  that hid because most routers use the default interface name and matched by
  accident.
- **Dashboard cards that stopped updating** after you visited the page they share
  a collector with and navigated away.
- **A closed browser tab left collectors running** until the connection timed out.
- **The DHCP and Connections pages could lose their device names** on a router
  where the lease table is keyed by a different address than the one in use.
- **The ARP poll interval setting was saved, validated and read by nothing.**

### Internal

- Three layer split: acquisition, derivation and views. Every collector's
  rows-to-payload step is now a plain function that can be tested without a
  router.
- 58 static self checks, all failing in both directions: an unrecorded gap fails,
  and so does a recorded gap that has since closed.
- The behavioural guidelines were rewritten after they were measured causing
  harm, and the risk appetite is now stated rather than implied.

## [0.8.21] - The IPv6 firewall, and the WebSocket works behind a reverse proxy again

The Firewall page gains IPv6, per device and fully editable. MikroDash can be reached
through a reverse proxy again, which has been broken since the 0.8 rewrite (#128).
Four controls that were drawn but never wired now do what they say.

### Added

- **The Firewall page has an IPv4 | IPv6 switch.** All four IPv6 tables — filter, NAT,
  mangle and raw — with the same add, edit, reorder and delete as IPv4. The rule
  vocabularies are IPv6's own: no `tarpit`, `change-hop-limit` in place of
  `change-ttl`, `icmpv6` rather than `ipv6-icmp`, and a different `reject-with` set.
- **"Show IPv6 in cards"**, beside the search box, folds IPv6 into Rule Counts, Action
  Breakdown and Chain Count. Off by default and remembered per browser.
- **IPv6 is only read when it is being looked at.** Nothing is asked of a router until
  the IPv6 tab is open or that box is ticked, so an IPv4-only device costs nothing. The
  tab hides itself on a router with IPv6 switched off.
- **`MIKRODASH_ORIGINS`** (or `--origins`) allows the Origin hosts a reverse proxy
  presents. Comma separated, wildcards allowed. (#128)

### Fixed

- **MikroDash would not work behind a reverse proxy, and had not since 0.8.1.** The
  WebSocket handshake was refused whenever the browser's address differed from the
  address MikroDash sees, which is every proxied setup. The UI loaded and stayed empty.
  Set `MIKRODASH_ORIGINS` to the host you browse to. (#128)
- **A firewall rule could lock MikroDash out of a router without warning.** The
  self-lockout check only ever looked at IPv4 rules. It now checks both families, and
  no longer warns about rules in the family it is not connected over.
- **The Visible Pages presets did nothing.** Home, Standard, Advanced and Custom had no
  click handler at all.
- **The Add Role presets and the All read / All write buttons did nothing**, for the
  same reason.
- **The Devices page's site filter did nothing.** Choosing a site left every device on
  screen.
- **A blank Devices page now says why.** An account that can open the page but has not
  been granted the routers looked exactly like an install with no devices. (#129)
- Device cards centre instead of packing to the left.

### Internal

- Counter deltas were shared between IPv4 and IPv6 rules with the same RouterOS id,
  which would have produced plausible but wrong packet rates on dual-stack routers.
- Three new self-checks, two of which caught a live bug the day they were written: every
  server option is set by the binary, every rule table reaches the firewall's change
  detection, and every collector's emptiness key names a real field.

## [0.8.20] - Manage PPP accounts, and a fresh container is healthy before a device is added

PPPoE account management arrives on the PPP page (#125). A container with no device
configured no longer reports itself broken, which was deadlocking the RouterOS App
install (#120). A Cloud Hosted Router is handled properly throughout (#121). Plus the
Devices page review from 0.8.19.

### Added

- **PPP accounts can be managed, not just watched.** The PPP page gains a Secrets tab —
  search, add, edit, enable, disable, delete — alongside editable Profiles and read-only
  PPPoE Servers, now three tabs on one card above the sessions table. An account's badge
  distinguishes "disabled" from "offline": one was switched off, the other is simply not
  dialled in. (#125)
- **A password is never read.** The collector does not ask RouterOS for it, so no payload
  can carry one. Setting a password sends it to the router; leaving the field blank keeps
  the existing one.

### Fixed

- **A fresh container reported itself unhealthy for ever.** `/healthz` answered 503 until a
  device was configured, which is exactly the state a newly started container is meant to be
  in. This deadlocked the RouterOS App install: the App withholds its UI link until the
  container is healthy, and a device can only be added through that UI. There are three
  states now — no device configured is healthy, a device that has not answered yet is
  starting, and a device still silent past the grace window is unhealthy. Reported by
  Christoph on #120.
- **The Devices page was hidden on a one-device install.** A rule inherited from the old app
  hid the fleet page until a second device was added. It is deleted; use the Devices switch
  in Visible Pages if you want it hidden. Reported on #121.
- **A Cloud Hosted Router is handled properly.** Verified against a real CHR running
  RouterOS 7.24.2, which contradicted two assumptions in the code:
  - restoring a backup to a CHR was refused outright, because the restore asked for a
    RouterBOARD serial number that a virtual router does not have;
  - its licence badge read "Lfree" instead of "free" — the "L" belongs to a RouterBOARD's
    L4 and L6, not to a CHR's named levels;
  - a stored backup recorded no model for it, so one device was named two different ways;
  - it was labelled as an inferred device type on Network Topology rather than a router.
- **Three tables still named page keys renamed on 2026-09-01**, and each failed silently
  because an unknown page key is denied rather than reported:
  - the WiFi Networks page drew no Add button and its rows did not open — not even for an
    administrator;
  - the WiFi scan permission could not be granted to any role;
  - the Roles editor offered five pages that no longer existed and omitted five that do.
- **The PPP card went stale on a router with nothing to report.** A router with no PPP
  produces an identical payload for ever, so the card was marked stale for lack of news
  rather than lack of health.

### Internal

- **A device card could show "Offline", with a login failure, beside a live CPU reading.** If a
  device's password had been changed or a connection timed out at the wrong moment, the card took
  its status from one connection and its gauges from another. It now waits until both agree, so a
  device that is down shows empty gauges — which is what "not read yet" is supposed to look like.
- **A device could stop recording silently after its Reporting switch was toggled.** Depending on
  timing, the history collectors could fail to start and stay stopped until the switch was toggled
  again. Nothing reported it; the device simply stopped appearing in new Reports data. Introduced
  in 0.8.19.
- **A device kept a blank card after its live connection timed out.** With the Devices page open,
  a device you had stopped looking at showed a green "online" badge over empty CPU, memory and
  uptime for a few seconds. The gauges are now filled the same way they are when the page opens.
- **An unresponsive device tied up its own connection budget.** A device that was connected but had
  stopped answering left reads outstanding with no time limit, and opening or switching devices
  started more of them. Reads now give up on time, and only one is in flight per device.

### Internal

- The gauge read taken for a device with no collectors is one command, not two. It was also asking
  for the health menu, which supplies a temperature no card displays.
- A data race on the reporting flag, reported by `go test -race` and the cause of the silent-stop
  above.
- The diagnostic line that reports how many devices were read on page open no longer counts
  readings from a previous visit, so a device that has stopped answering can be seen in the log
  rather than hidden by its own last success.
- Tests for each fix, every one of them failing on the unfixed code first. The documentation audit
  now re-measures `CONTRIBUTING.md` as well as `CLAUDE.md`, and both places each number is written
  — it had been checking one of two and the unchecked copy had drifted.
- The architecture diagram is committed under `docs/archify/`, as a typed spec plus the rendered
  page, so it can be corrected rather than left to rot. It had the write path wrong: writes now go
  server to resource to guard, which is the path the code takes. Nothing regenerates it
  automatically and no check compares it against the tree.
- Two recorded corpora that had gone unread since the parity harness was retired are read again,
  covering three shipping functions that had no test at all. Five deliberate mutations were killed
  by boundary cases a hand-written table would not have included.
- Two stray scratch files removed, and `tools/capture-fixtures.js` is text rather than binary — four
  literal NUL bytes had made every content search skip it silently.

## [0.8.19] - Choose which devices are reported on, and a crash on the Devices page

### Added

- **A Reporting switch on each device**, beside Alert Monitoring. Turn it on for the devices whose
  history you actually want and MikroDash records traffic, bandwidth, ping and uptime for them; turn
  it off and nothing is written to disk for that device at all.

  Until now exactly one device was recorded — whichever one was currently selected — and there was no
  way to see that, let alone change it. Several devices can now be recorded at once, and the cost is
  a data stream rather than a new connection, so a device you are not reporting on still shows its
  online state instantly.

  **Nothing changes when you upgrade.** On first start each existing device is given the setting it
  effectively had: on for the currently selected device, off for the rest. Data already recorded is
  kept, and turning reporting back on simply resumes.

  A device with reporting off still alerts and still sends notifications; what it does not do is keep
  a history, so it will not appear in Reports and its past alerts are not listed.

### Fixed

- **Leaving the Devices page could crash the whole application.** A frame sent to a browser that had
  just disconnected took the server down with it, restarting every connection, the history recorder
  and alerting. Observed on a live install. The Devices page made it likely rather than special: its
  two-second refresh could still be running as the page closed.
- **Reports → Connectivity showed devices flapping online and offline.** A routine reconnect takes
  about five seconds, and every one of them was being written down as an outage. There is a delay
  before an outage is recorded now — the device's own "offline threshold", 30 seconds by default — so
  a brief blip no longer appears as one. This corrects a regression introduced in 0.8.18.
- **The health check could report the active device as disconnected while it was up**, which on some
  setups is enough for the container to be restarted automatically. It consulted two of the three
  places a device connection can live.
- **Editing a device left a connection open to every other device**, for as long as the application
  ran, whether or not anyone was looking at them.

### Internal

- The single hidden "history device" is gone rather than generalised: recording is a property of each
  device, so the mechanism that tracked one, and the leak guard it needed, went with it.
- A device with reporting off keeps its alert de-duplication in memory. The database was doing that
  job, so simply not writing rows would have produced repeat notifications for ever and no recovery
  notifications at all.

## [0.8.18] - An empty dashboard after a restart, and history that keeps itself

### Fixed

- **Signing in after a restart sometimes gave a dashboard of empty, stale cards.** The router showed
  in the corner with a green dot and the connection was genuinely fine, which is what made it so
  confusing — everything that still worked was something that did not need the page. A refresh fixed
  it, and that was the only cure. The browser sends two messages as it starts up and their order is
  not guaranteed; if they arrived the less common way round, the page was left subscribed to nothing
  for as long as that tab stayed open. Reported twice. Verified against live routers by forcing the
  bad order: the affected cards received nothing before, and everything after.
- **A traffic graph that silently stopped was never restarted.** RouterOS pushes traffic readings
  and never acknowledges them, so a router that stops sending leaves an open connection, a healthy
  status, and a chart that has simply stopped. Nothing errored, so nothing retried. MikroDash now
  notices a stream that has gone quiet for ten seconds and reopens it, and says so on the card when
  a stream keeps failing.
- **Test email failed against Microsoft 365 and Outlook** with "504 5.7.4 Unrecognized authentication
  type". MikroDash only ever offered one sign-in method, and those servers do not accept it. It now
  uses whichever method the server actually advertises. Other providers are unaffected.
- **Bandwidth and traffic history was only recorded while somebody had the Dashboard open.** Which
  interfaces got written to history depended on which ones a browser happened to be watching, so a
  report covered a series full of holes and presented the total as if it were complete. History is
  now a property of the device: an interface is recorded continuously or not at all.
- **The install-wide "default interface" setting was ignored.** It was read under the wrong name, so
  changing it did nothing anywhere. It also had three different fallbacks in three places; a device
  with no interface of its own recorded no history at all in the background.

### Changed

- **A router that rejects the sign-in is retried far less often.** A wrong password used to put a
  failed login into the router's own log every five seconds for as long as MikroDash ran; it now
  backs off to at most five minutes. A router that is unreachable or rebooting is unaffected and
  still retried quickly, and correcting the password takes effect immediately.

### Internal

- Three new checks for the class of bug behind two of the fixes above: that the router-select
  handler re-establishes every subscription it drops, that every entry point on the history recorder
  is actually called by the shipped binary, and that URLs built into links are covered by the
  endpoint audit rather than only ones passed to `fetch`.

## [0.8.17] - Editing a device no longer forgets its password

### Fixed

- **Saving the Add/Edit Device dialog wiped that router's password.** Not on an unusual path: open
  the dialog, change anything, press Save. The device then failed to authenticate for good, while
  Test Connection carried on passing — which is what made it look like the app rather than the
  stored credential. On disk the sealed password and the dialog's own password box share one name,
  and the box's contents were written straight over the credential. A blank box, which is the
  normal case because the dialog clears it and promises "leave blank to keep current", replaced it
  with nothing. Issue #124.
- **Correcting a password did not reach the running connection.** It was written to the file and
  nothing else: the app kept presenting the old credential until the container was restarted, so
  the obvious way to recover from the bug above did not work either. Changing a device's address,
  port, username or TLS settings had the same problem.
- **The Gbps/Mbps buttons in the device dialog did nothing.** They were drawn and connected to
  nothing at all. Opening a device stored in Mbps also highlighted "Gbps" over a field that meant
  Mbps, so the control disagreed with the value it was showing. Issue #124.
- **The .rsc and .backup download links on the Backups page returned "404 page not found".** Both
  routes were missing from the server entirely, so every download link on the page led nowhere.
  Downloading needs write access to that device, as the page already assumed.
- **Reports → Connectivity reported every router down.** Connection up and down events had not been
  recorded since the Go changeover, so the page was reading a table that stopped being written and
  showing the last thing in it: a permanent outage and about 2% uptime. Recording is back.
  Historical ranges covering the gap will still show that stretch as one long outage, because the
  missing data cannot be recovered; from this release onward the figures are real again.

### Changed

- **A router that rejects the login is retried more slowly.** The interval was a flat five seconds
  whatever the reason, so a wrong password put a failed login into the router's own log every five
  seconds for as long as MikroDash ran. It now backs off to at most five minutes. A router that is
  unreachable, rebooting or simply slow is unaffected and still retried quickly, and correcting the
  credential takes effect immediately rather than waiting out the backoff.

### Internal

- The store now refuses a router password that has not been sealed, so the mistake behind the first
  fix cannot be repeated by a future caller.
- The endpoint audit reads URLs built into links, not only ones passed to `fetch`. That gap is why
  two missing routes shipped unnoticed.
- A new check requires every entry point on the history recorder to have a caller in the shipped
  binary. Both halves of connectivity recording were correct, fully tested and simply not connected
  to each other, which no unit test could see.

## [0.8.16] - A new install can connect its first router

### Fixed

- **A clean install could not connect its first router.** The setup wizard saved the device and
  then reported "could not read the settings". The router really was saved, which made it look
  like it had half worked — the failure was the step immediately after, which could not cope with
  a settings file that does not exist yet on a brand new install. Issue #127.
- **The Connections map drew no arcs for a router behind another router.** The arcs start from
  your own location, which was only ever worked out from the WAN address — and a router behind
  another router has a private address that cannot be placed. The map coloured countries and
  counted them and drew nothing between them, with no setting that helped. It now falls back to
  the location set on the device, so picking a town gives you your arcs. Issue #120.

### Internal

- The rule that a missing configuration file means "not set up yet" rather than "broken" now lives
  in one place, with a check covering every reader at once. This was the third release in a week
  to fix one instance of it.

## [0.8.15] - Settings can be saved again

### Fixed

- **The Save button on the Settings page did nothing.** It was drawn, it was enabled, and nothing
  at all was listening for a click on it, so no setting could be saved from any tab — poll
  intervals, notification channels, alert thresholds, which pages are shown, session timeout.
  Reset beside it worked, which is what made the page look normal. Reported as "Appearance Save
  not working", which was simply where it was noticed. Issue #126.
- **The "Require sign-in" toggle always showed as off**, whatever the install was actually set to,
  because nothing ever read the real value into it. It now shows the truth.

### Internal

- A new check refuses any button that only the permissions layer touches. That is the exact shape
  of the last three broken controls: enabled and disabled correctly, wired to nothing, and each
  one found by somebody clicking it rather than by a test.
- Saving a form no longer sends blank password fields, which the server reads as "clear this".

## [0.8.14] - A new install is shown how to add its router

### Fixed

- **A new install landed on an empty dashboard with no way to know what to do.** MikroDash has a
  first-run wizard that asks for a router's address and credentials, and it could only ever be
  triggered by deleting your last router — so it never appeared on a genuinely new install, which
  is the one situation it exists for. New installs now open it straight away. Issue #124.
- **A missing `routers.json` was treated as a fault rather than as an empty fleet**, which logged
  an error on every start of a new install and was what kept the wizard hidden.

## [0.8.13] - A new install can add its first router

### Fixed

- **The Add Device button did nothing.** On the Settings page it rendered, it was enabled, and
  nothing at all was listening for a click on it, so the dialog never opened and no error appeared
  anywhere. On an install that already has routers this was an annoyance; on a new one it was a
  dead end, because the first-run overlay was the only other way into that dialog. Anyone who
  dismissed it, or who reached Settings before it appeared, had no way to add their first router.
  Issue #124.
- **Page navigation did not work at all until a router existed.** On an install with no routers
  the page router was never started, so a link straight to `/settings` quietly landed on the
  dashboard and the browser's back and forward buttons did nothing. The sidebar still worked,
  which is what made it look like a settings problem rather than a navigation one. Same new
  install blind spot as the button above.

## [0.8.12] - Fresh installs, the Devices page, and two long-standing map bugs

### Fixed

- **A brand new install still could not create its first account.** The setup wizard never
  appeared: the login page offered a Sign In form while the Create Admin Account form stayed
  hidden, so there was no account to sign in with and no way to make one. A missing user file was
  being reported as a read error instead of as "no users yet". 0.8.11 created the files a new
  install needs; this is the same issue one layer up, and it is now tested end to end on an empty
  volume with no environment variables set. Issue #124.
- **No site location could be saved, on any install.** Picking a town answered "Pick a town from
  the list, or clear the location", which is what the user had just done. The town search returned
  full region names ("North Rhine-Westphalia") while the validator still expected the three letter
  codes the old geo database used, so the app was refusing places its own search had offered.
  99.6% of towns were affected. Issue #120.
- **The Connections map, Top Countries, Connection Flow, Top Ports and Top Destinations were all
  empty** for anyone whose router has a catch all `0.0.0.0/0` DHCP network. Every destination was
  being treated as local and dropped. The connection count, the client picker and Top Sources kept
  working, which is why it looked like a display problem rather than a filter. Issue #120.
- **Devices showed every device as offline for the first few seconds.** The page now reports what
  it actually knows: a device nothing has reached yet reads "Checking" rather than a red Offline,
  and rows are filled from the always-on pool so real state is there on the first paint. Returning
  to the page is instant instead of re-dialling the fleet.
- **The Devices map stopped plotting devices**, because their location was not being sent to the
  page.
- **The notification bell would not close when you clicked away.** The only way to dismiss it was
  to find the bell and click it again.
- **The Devices page sat in a narrow column on wide screens**, and its cards stopped getting wider
  past 1200px. Issue #122.

### Internal

- The town search and the place validator are now checked against each other, so the app cannot
  offer a location it will refuse to store.
- A pool session that has not finished its first dial is no longer reported as offline anywhere.
- Handing a router between the two connection pools no longer leaves a gap where neither is
  watching it.

## [0.8.11] - A new install can be set up again

### Fixed

- **A fresh install could not be set up at all, and this release is the fix.** On a new `/data`
  MikroDash exited before serving a page, because it expected an encryption key file that only the
  old Node version ever created. Even past that, it had no database, so the first administrator
  account was created holding no permissions and could not add a router. Anyone upgrading was
  unaffected, which is why it went unnoticed: the missing files were already in their `/data`.
  Reported as issue #124 by users installing from the RouterOS container catalogue, where the
  volume is empty by definition.
- **Backup notifications work again.** Drift ("Configuration changed") and failure ("Backup
  failed") were sent by the Node version and were lost in the rewrite, so scheduled backups have
  been silent, including when they failed. An unchanged backup still says nothing, deliberately:
  a daily message that reports nothing is a channel people mute.
- **The DHCP page showed 0% for every subnet.** Lease counts and the IP Utilisation gauge read
  zero while the subnet rows and the lease table were populated, because the two collectors
  started in the wrong order and the result was then held for a ten minute poll interval.
- **The DHCP page on a device with no DHCP server** kept showing the previously selected router's
  subnets instead of saying it has none.
- **Network Topology re-read the router every 3 seconds** regardless of its configured interval.
  The map still updates at the same rate; it just stops asking the router for the parts that have
  not changed.
- **Stale API sessions on the router.** A reconnect abandoned its connection without closing it, a
  router that was open in the Devices page kept a second connection for as long as the app ran,
  and disabling or deleting a router left it polled for two more minutes.
- **Alert checks and history stopped for every router after opening the Devices page**, until
  something else happened to restart them.
- **"End Session" on the Users page** now shows "Closing..." while it works, and says so plainly
  when RouterOS refuses. RouterOS will not end API or REST API sessions; that refusal was
  previously invisible.

### Internal

- Router CPU measured across four states before changing anything. The spikes reported were
  present with MikroDash stopped, so no collector was altered.
- The database schema is now created by MikroDash rather than inherited from the Node version.
- One goroutine per router connection was being leaked for the lifetime of the process.
- New checks for first run, page keys, collector ordering and backup notification rules.

## [0.8.10] - Every page has its own URL

### New

- **Every page now has a real URL.** `/logs`, `/firewall`, `/wifi-clients`, `/settings` and the
  rest. Pages can be bookmarked and linked, the back and forward buttons move between them, and a
  refresh keeps you where you were instead of returning to the dashboard. The dashboard is served
  at `/home`.
- **Open a link while signed out and you land on it after signing in**, rather than on the
  dashboard.
- **The "Device Users" page is now "Users"**, at `/users`. It was called three different things
  depending on where you looked.

### Fixed

- **The Traffic graph no longer restarts from nothing.** Any brief router reconnect, which happens
  routinely on an upgrade or a short drop, threw away the accumulated history and the chart began
  again from an empty axis.
- **The Traffic and Ping cards survive a page refresh.** Closing the last browser tab used to tear
  the router session down immediately, taking both charts' history with it, so a refresh started
  both from scratch. A session now stays warm for two minutes after the last viewer leaves. Walk
  away for longer and it still closes, so an unwatched router still costs nothing.
- **The Backups page shows one "No change" row instead of one per run.** On a stable router with a
  daily schedule these accumulated one a day and buried the entries that are real restore points.
  The runs are still recorded; only the table is filtered.
- **Routes, BGP Peers and Connection Flow now fill on the dashboard.** All three showed dashes
  unless you had opened the page that owns them.

### Internal

- Concurrent commands to a single router are capped at eight, across the viewing session, the
  background pool and the alert pool together. Nothing bounded them before, and the documented
  bottleneck on a MikroTik is concurrent API channels.
- The port-parity harness is retired. It compared this app against a recording of the Node
  implementation it replaced, which is a question that ended with the port. The checks that asked
  something else became 26 Go tests and 25 frontend tests.
- Page keys now come from one list in `internal/pages` instead of five hand-maintained copies, and
  each key matches the page's name.
- The TypeScript payload types are generated from the Go structs.
- Both open code scanning alerts resolved as false positives, one of them pinned by a new test that
  runs on 32-bit as well as 64-bit.

## [0.8.2] - The Connections card fills straight away again

### Fixed

- **The Connections card was empty after a restart until you visited the Connections page.** The
  dashboard asks for its cards as the grid lays out, which is before the router connection has
  finished opening, and that request was being dropped silently with nothing to ask again. Every
  card fed by the connection table was affected: Connection Flow, Top Countries, Top Ports and the
  Connections Map. It now fills within a few seconds of the dashboard loading.

  Anything that dropped and restored the connection used to fix it, which is why it looked like the
  card "eventually recovered".

### Internal

- `docs/architecture-next.md` re-measured against the Go tree: of the three changes
  proposed before the port, one shipped with it, one is half done, and one is still open. The
  numbers behind each are now the current ones rather than the JavaScript app's.

## [0.8.1] - MikroDash is now Go and TypeScript

The rewrite proposed in [#114](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/114) replaces the
Node.js implementation. It has been serving in production since 2026-08-30, and this is the first
published image of it.

**Nothing about the dashboard changed, and that was the point.** Every page, colour, keyboard
shortcut and setting is where you left it. The frontend reuses the original stylesheet, class names,
element ids and DOM shape verbatim; only the logic producing them was rewritten. That was the
acceptance criterion throughout, enforced by 136 checks that drive both implementations from one
payload and compare the rendered HTML character for character.

### What you get

- **ARMv7 support is back.** It was dropped at 0.5.54 because the Node base image published no
  32-bit ARM build, which stranded anyone on older hardware two years behind. `linux/arm/v7` is
  published again alongside amd64 and arm64, so a Raspberry Pi 2/3, an older NanoPi or a 32-bit
  router-adjacent box can run current MikroDash.
- **The image is 180 MB instead of 775 MB.** A single static binary on Alpine: no Node runtime, no
  `node_modules`, no native compilation at install time. Faster to pull, faster to start, and far
  less surface to patch.
- **Nothing to migrate.** Point the new image at your existing volume and it picks up every history
  sample, alert, audit row, saved layout, user and encrypted setting exactly as they are.
- **Geolocation needs no account.** The city database is DB-IP City Lite, fetched fresh when the
  image is built: no sign-up, no licence key, no token that expires and quietly breaks the map
  months later. Point `-geo` at a volume if you would rather supply your own.
- **A type-checked frontend.** A whole class of bug that used to surface as a button that silently
  did nothing is now caught before the code ships.
- **Rollback is one command.** The Node release is still there: `docker run` the `0.7.40` image
  against the same volume. Anything the Go release wrote, the Node release can still read.

### Upgrading

Pull and restart. Your `docker-compose.yml` needs no change, and the volume is used as-is.

One thing worth knowing: **`docker restart` is not a redeploy.** It keeps the image the container
was created from, so a newly pulled image is ignored while the app comes back looking perfectly
healthy. Use `docker compose up -d`, or `docker rm -f` then `docker run`.

### Fixed

- Everything in 0.7.40 is included, including the certificate-check and router-enable fixes and the
  read-only account that could read a device's public IP address.
- **0.8.0 was tagged but never published.** Its image build failed on the 32-bit ARM target it had
  just restored: an AS number is 32-bit unsigned, and on a 32-bit build a large private ASN could
  not be parsed at all, so a private BGP peer would have been labelled upstream. Two related
  constants would not compile there either. Fixed and verified on all three architectures.
- Two defects the cutover itself surfaced: a migration flag that made the app proxy some routes to
  itself and silently disable background polling and history retention, and twelve verification
  checks that would have become a permanent silent skip.

### Internal

- The Node implementation is removed from the tree. It remains in this repository's history and at
  the `v0.7.40` tag.
- The verification travels with the repo: every check compares against a committed recording of the
  old implementation, so a fresh clone can run `sh tools/verify.sh` and get a meaningful answer. The
  final comparison against the real Node source ran immediately before deletion and was green.

## [0.8.0] - MikroDash is now Go and TypeScript (tagged, never published)

> **No image was published for this version.** The build failed on 32-bit ARM; 0.8.1 is the
> same cutover with that fix and is the release to use. This entry is kept as the record.

The rewrite proposed in [#114](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/114) replaces the
Node.js implementation. It has been serving in production since 2026-08-30.

**Nothing user-visible changed, by design.** The frontend reuses the original stylesheet, class
names, element ids and DOM shape verbatim — only the logic producing them was rewritten. That was
the acceptance criterion throughout, checked by gates that drive both implementations from one
payload and compare the rendered HTML.

### New

- **ARMv7 is back.** It was dropped at 0.5.54 because `node:24-alpine` published no 32-bit ARM
  variant, which stranded users on older hardware. The image is now a static Go binary on Alpine,
  so `linux/arm/v7` is published again alongside amd64 and arm64.
- **A much smaller image**: 180 MB against 775 MB, with no Node runtime, no `node_modules` and no
  native compilation step. `/data` is still the only mount.
- **Type checking over the whole frontend.** A class of bug that used to fail at click time now
  fails at build time.
- **Geolocation no longer depends on an npm package.** The city database is DB-IP City Lite,
  fetched fresh at image build — no account, no licence key, no expiring token. Point `-geo` at a
  volume to supply your own.

### Changed

- The container is `mikrodash-go` and the image is built from the same `docker-compose.yml` as
  before. **Your existing `mikrodash_data` volume is used unchanged** — history, alerts, audit
  rows, settings and users all carry over, and the Node release can still read anything the Go
  release writes.
- **`docker restart` is not a redeploy.** It keeps the image the container was created from, so a
  rebuilt image is silently ignored while the app comes back looking healthy. Use `docker compose
  up -d` after a build, or `docker rm -f` then `docker run`.

### Fixed

Everything in 0.7.40 is included. Two defects the cutover itself found were fixed before release: a
migration flag that made the app proxy un-ported routes to itself and silently disabled the
background pool and the retention sweep, and twelve verification checks that would have become a
permanent silent skip.

### Internal

- The Node implementation is removed from the tree. It remains in this repository's history and at
  the `v0.7.40` tag.
- Verification travels with the repo: every gate compares against a committed recording of the old
  implementation, so a fresh clone can run `sh tools/verify.sh` meaningfully. The final comparison
  against the real Node source ran immediately before deletion and was green.

## [0.7.40] - The last Node release, and the fixes the Go port found

The final release of MikroDash on Node.js. Everything below was found by comparing this app against
the Go and TypeScript port endpoint by endpoint, which is a check no test on either side could
perform: a round trip through one implementation agrees with itself whatever it does.

### Fixed

- **Turning off "accept self-signed certificate" could turn it on.** A client that sends the value as
  text rather than as a boolean had it read backwards, so a router saved with certificate checking
  ON accepted a forged certificate on every later connection. Four places did this; one was fixed in
  0.7.37 and the other three, including the Test Connection button, were not.
- **Enabling a disabled router could disable it.** The same reading applied to the enabled/disabled
  switch, and to the per-router alert toggle. Values stored by an earlier version are now corrected
  when they are read, so a router already saved the wrong way rights itself.
- **The router list gave away each device's public IP address.** `/api/routers` returned the WAN
  address that three other paths deliberately withhold, so anyone who could see a router at all
  could read it, including read-only accounts.
- **A user could be renamed to "null".** Sending an empty username as JSON null renamed the account
  to those four characters instead of being refused, and later alert acknowledgements were recorded
  against it.
- **Error messages could reveal internal hostnames.** The "Test" button on personal notification
  channels is available to every account, and a failure named the host it had tried to reach, so an
  ordinary user could learn which internal names resolve. Addresses were already hidden; names now
  are too.
- **A disabled router's status badge said "Offline", or briefly "Online".** The row stayed dimmed
  with an Enable button beside it, which read as a contradiction until the page was refreshed.
- **The Traffic dropdown lost the selected interface after a reconnect.** The list stopped emptying
  in 0.7.38, but the chosen interface still reverted to the default. Choosing an interface now
  survives a dropped connection, and still resets when a different router is selected.
  ([#119](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/119))
- **The connection test named the wrong service.** A failure over api-ssl could be reported as a
  plain `api` problem and the other way round, and the commonest failure of all, a wrong username or
  password, was reported as a raw driver message.

### Internal

- 1,670 tests, up from 1,628. Every fix above was proved by reintroducing the defect and watching a
  named test fail, rather than by reading the code.
- Checks that scan the source now cover the whole file or the whole tree instead of a window near
  the code they describe. Two of them had been passing without reaching the line they were written
  for.

## [0.7.38] - Release notes in the Update dialog, and the Traffic dropdown fix that actually works

### New

- **The Update dialog shows the release notes** for the version it is offering, in a scrollable box
  above the reboot warning. The decision to restart a router is now made against what changed rather
  than against two version numbers. The notes come from MikroTik, because the router does not carry
  them; an install with no route to the internet sees "Release notes unavailable" and everything else
  works as before.

### Fixed

- **The Traffic dropdown still lost its interfaces in 0.7.37.** The earlier fix did not prevent the
  problem, it completed it. An interface that reports late, such as a ZeroTier tunnel, ended up
  replacing the whole list instead of joining it, which is why one reporter's dropdown contained
  exactly `zerotier1`. ([#119](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/119), thanks
  [@steenekenm](https://github.com/steenekenm) and
  [@erion1979-cell](https://github.com/erion1979-cell))
- **Alerts went quiet on large fleets.** Past 500 tracked interfaces, VPN peers, NetWatch hosts or
  BGP peers, the alerter discarded what it knew about all of them at once. On a router at that size
  a fleet-wide outage produced a single alert. It now forgets only what the router has stopped
  reporting.
- **A second RouterOS release is announced.** A router left un-updated across two releases was only
  ever told about the first.
- **A site could be created called "null"** by a form field that had been cleared, and creating a
  second one then reported that the name was already taken.
- Saving site membership sent every open browser a duplicate refresh.

### Internal

- Release-note lookups validate the version against a strict whitelist before any request is made,
  cache per version, cap the response size while it downloads and time out.
- A test suite can be confidently green about something it never checks: several rules added
  recently were verified by removing them and watching the tests still pass. Those gaps are closed.
- 1620 tests, 25 more than 0.7.37.

## [0.7.37] - Fixes for the Devices page, reports and alerts

### Fixed

- **The Save and Test Connection buttons in the device editor did nothing.** A scripting error broke
  both, silently, with no message to say why. This is what made sites look unremovable in
  [#117](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/117).
- **Editing a device no longer asks you to retype its password.** The field says "leave blank to keep
  current", but saving then failed because the connection test had no password to use. The stored one
  is now reused, as long as the host, port, username and TLS settings are unchanged.
- **The Traffic dropdown lost all but one interface** after a couple of minutes. Reported on a
  CCR2004; more likely the more interfaces a router has.
  ([#119](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/119), thanks
  [@steenekenm](https://github.com/steenekenm))
- **The site filter could label a site wrongly** on the Devices page when a device still listed a
  deleted site. Picking that entry filtered to the wrong site.
- **Report PDFs had no separator in the date range.** The character used had no glyph in the report
  font, so it was invisible in every report.
- **Report chart dates flipped day and month** when a display timezone was set, so 08-09 and 09-08
  could mean the same day depending on a setting the reader cannot see.
- **A failed ntfy notification now says why** instead of showing a bare status code.
- The Backups table no longer fills with runs that found nothing to back up.
- A report run with no history left the box blank instead of saying so, and its table put values
  under the wrong headings.
- One malformed row no longer blanks the whole Audit table.
- The Bandwidth and Dashboard charts could disagree by one sample after a router corrected its clock.
- Restoring a backup on a router with no stored backup settings sent an invalid password.

### Changed

- **Site membership is now set in Settings → Access Management → Sites only.** The device editor
  keeps a **Primary site** picker, which chooses where the device is drawn on the map. Membership
  decides who can reach a device, so it belongs with the other access controls.

### Internal

- Interface cycles are delimited by the marker RouterOS already sends, rather than by a timer.
- A test now catches the class of scripting error behind the broken buttons, which had appeared
  twice.
- Two notes in the RouterOS patch file are corrected against fresh hardware traces; one described a
  failure as silent when it is not.
- 1588 tests, 25 more than 0.7.36.

## [0.7.36] - Devices can belong to several sites

### New

- **The Routers page is now Devices.** A fleet holds switches and access points too, so the name no
  longer claims otherwise. Custom roles keep the page across the upgrade.
  ([#117](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/117), thanks
  [@erion1979-cell](https://github.com/erion1979-cell))
- **A device can belong to more than one site.** Assigning it to a second site no longer removes it
  from the first. A grant on any of its sites reaches it, and the first site listed is the primary,
  which is what places it on the map.
- **Sites card** on the Devices page, counting the distinct sites your devices are assigned to.
- **Site filter** on the left of the Devices toolbar. All Sites by default, then each site, plus
  Unassigned when such a device exists. It narrows the cards, the list and the map together.
- The device editor takes multiple sites and lets you pick which one is primary. Site names are
  searchable.

### Fixed

- **Switching routers could hang for 30 seconds.** A request already in flight when the old
  connection went away had no way to fail, so it waited out the full write timeout, and with 26
  collectors they all waited at once. Requests now fail as soon as the connection goes.
  ([#118](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/118))
- **A disconnected banner that would not clear** when switching to a router already connected in the
  background. That switch also left the traffic chart unbound until you reloaded.
- **Only administrators can change which sites a device is in.** Previously anyone who could edit a
  device could set its site, which decides who can reach it.
- **The Backups table no longer fills with no-op runs.** A run that found nothing changed has nothing
  to restore, and on a stable router with a daily schedule those rows crowded out the real restore
  points. The newest one is kept so you can still see the schedule fired.
- **The update banner stopped flickering** once per poll on the Dashboard.
- **The report history table put values under the wrong headings**, and a report run with no history
  left the box blank instead of saying so.
- One malformed row in the Audit table no longer blanks the whole table.
- The Bandwidth chart and the Dashboard chart could disagree by one sample after a router corrected
  its clock.
- Restoring a backup on a router with no stored backup settings sent a literal `undefined` password.
- The Connections country list is updated in place, so hovering and clicking no longer fight with the
  live refresh.
- CAPsMAN now distinguishes "no results for your search" from "no clients connected".

### Internal

- The RouterOS client carries one close signal per connection, so a teardown mid-request cannot leave
  a request unsettled or a login open that nobody owns.
- Site membership is stored as a list, with the old single value kept in step so an older build still
  reads it.
- 1563 tests, 21 more than 0.7.35.

## [0.7.35] - An interface name can no longer inject markup

### Security

- **A quote in an interface name could inject an attribute into the Dashboard.** The Physical Ports
  card and the API Diagnostics card built their tooltips with a text-only escaper, which leaves `"`
  and `'` untouched by design. Confirmed on RouterOS 7.24 that a quoted name is accepted and reaches
  the browser intact, so an interface called `ether1" onmouseover="x` could inject an attribute.
  Exploiting it requires the ability to name an interface on a monitored router, so it is not remote,
  but it is real. The Interfaces page was never affected: it always used the correct escaper.

### Fixed

- **The Logs card no longer starts blank.** The log history the server sends when a browser connects
  was silently discarded, so the card stayed empty until you opened it and it refetched.

### Internal

- CI and the pre-push hook run the suite in the image that carries the dev tooling. A test needing a
  dev-only tool previously failed to load rather than failing, taking its whole file with it.
- A collector timer bounds itself where it is created instead of relying only on upstream clamping.
- All GitHub code scanning alerts are resolved, each either fixed or dismissed with a written reason.
- Release notes are short scannable points, and version headings no longer require an em dash.

## [0.7.34] - Interface comments in alerts, and a DHCP gauge that adds up

### New

- **`{{comment}}` notification variable.** Alerts can now carry the RouterOS comment for the
  interface, NetWatch host, VPN peer or BGP peer they are about. Add it to your template under
  Settings, Notifications, Message Templates, for example `{{alertType}}: {{detail}} ({{comment}})`.
  It is not in the default template, so nothing changes unless you add it.
  ([#116](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/116), thanks
  [@erion1979-cell](https://github.com/erion1979-cell))

### Fixed

- **"DHCP used IPs" over-reported utilisation.** Static reservations nobody was using counted as in
  use, and leases that disappeared were never cleared in poll mode. A /23 could read 507 of 512 used
  with about 110 addresses actually held. ([#115](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/115),
  thanks [@erion1979-cell](https://github.com/erion1979-cell))
- **Traffic chart could silently lose most of its window** and redraw short, then refill. One
  out-of-order sample, which a router emits when NTP corrects its clock, ended the redraw early.
- **Backup pruning could offer every real restore point for deletion** if a file it did not create
  sat in the backup folder.
- **Report rate card showed the wrong sample count**, counting bandwidth rows instead of traffic
  samples.
- **A firewall address written without a prefix matched every address**, so blocking a single host
  did not raise the lockout warning it should have.
- **Queue edits recorded changes nobody made**, and said a field had been cleared when the router
  had kept its value.
- **Action status messages never appeared** on the WAN, Queues, Router Users and Packages pages.
- **Five Queues column headers offered a sort they do not have.** They are no longer marked
  sortable: a simple queue is first match wins, so position is meaningful.
- **Three values were rendered but never sent:** the upgrade dialog's channel line, the topology
  core node name, and the Bandwidth page device count.

### Internal

- The test suite stopped under-reporting its own size. 1527 tests, stable across runs.
- CI and the pre-push hook now run the suite in the image that carries the dev tooling.
- Three checks run on every build: orphaned element lookups, payload fields read but never sent, and
  variables written but never read.

### Discussion

- **Should MikroDash be rewritten in Go and TypeScript?** Comments wanted, objections as welcome as
  support. ([#114](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/114))

## [0.7.33] — Failures that never announced themselves

Every fix in this release is something that had been quietly not working. None of them logged an
error, none crashed, and several had been broken for weeks behind a green test suite. Most were
found by porting MikroDash to Go and TypeScript and discovering that the two implementations
disagreed.

**A daily backup at 08:00 now happens at 08:00.** The scheduler applied its 24-hour interval gate
*before* the wall-clock anchor, so a run late in the day pushed the next one past its own target. A
manual backup at 11:45 left "daily at 08:00" not due at 08:00 the next morning, and once it fired at
11:45 it stayed there permanently. One router's daily schedule had never fired once in its life;
another was drifting a couple of minutes later every day. Weekly and monthly keep the interval,
because "today at 08:00" knows an hour and a minute but not a weekday or a date.

**Clicking a column header sorts the table again.** Nine tables lost their sort on the first click
and could not recover it for the life of the page — VLANs, PPP, CAPsMAN, the three Bridges tables,
DNS, Packages and Audit. Two incompatible conventions for the sort direction were the cause, and the
second half of the same mismatch emitted a CSS class no stylesheet defines, so no arrow ever
appeared to contradict it. A table that had silently stopped sorting looked like one that had never
been sorted.

**An edit you make now reaches the page you are looking at.** Several collectors suppress a
redundant update by fingerprinting the payload, and those fingerprints were built from hand-written
field lists. Any field left off the list was invisible to the check: the collector re-read the
router, hashed an identical string, and returned without emitting. A comment-only edit to a DNS
entry wrote the router and never reached the open table. It hid because these collectors also hash
something that moves on its own, so on a busy router the table caught up a tick or two later and
merely looked slow; on an idle device the update never arrived at all. Fixed for DNS (`comment` and
`ttl`), interfaces (`type`, `comment`, MAC), queues (`comment`), and firewall — where the
fingerprint covered only rule counters, so *every* rule field, and rule order with it, reached the
page only when traffic happened to move a counter in the same tick.

**MX, NS and SRV DNS records survive being looked at.** The DNS form offered six of the nine record
types RouterOS supports. Opening an MX record showed its type as "A", and saving rewrote it as one:
the MX preference, the SRV target and port, the NS delegation, gone, with nothing on screen
suggesting the form was showing anything other than the record. All nine types are now supported
with their own fields, and, more generally, a form no longer silently coerces a value it does not
recognise into the first item of a list.

**The audit trail records what happened.** Two problems in the one table that cannot be pruned
selectively. Credential masking knew `private_key` but not `private-key`, `passphrase` but not
`pre-shared-key` — the settings vocabulary, not the router's. And because row values are real
booleans while form values are the strings `yes`/`no`, every save of every resource carrying a
checkbox recorded a change nobody made, burying the edit that did happen.

**Fewer bytes on the wire.** Routing sent every route's internal flags object to every viewer, up to
800 routes at a time, despite a comment claiming it did not and nothing on the page reading them.

### Merged contributions

Thanks to [@invoker-karl](https://github.com/invoker-karl) for both.

- **Fail closed when node-routeros compatibility patches are incomplete** ([#113]). The build no
  longer warns and continues when a compatibility patch cannot be applied. Underneath the headline
  sat a real gap: three of the seven patches were being applied and then never verified, so a
  dependency update could have dropped any of them silently. Marker matching is now token-bounded,
  so `MULTI_BLOCK_V2` can no longer satisfy a requirement for `MULTI_BLOCK`.
- **Fix missing action status handlers on WAN, Queues and Router Users** ([#112]). Six status calls
  on those three pages had no handler in scope. A write landed on the router and the browser then
  threw instead of reporting the result, so the operator saw nothing and assumed it had failed.

[#113]: https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/pull/113

## [0.7.32] — Wireless you can change, not just watch

MikroDash could see wireless in detail and change none of it. Every SSID edit, every passphrase
rotation, every provisioning tweak still meant opening WinBox. Two new surfaces close that: a **Wifi
Networks** page for a standalone router, and a **CAPsMAN configuration card** for a fleet.

Both are built on the resource engine that already serves routes, VLANs, bridges and firewall rules,
so they inherit its stale-row protection, undo, audit trail and permission gates rather than growing
a second way to write to a router.

**Passphrases are never read back.** `/interface/wifi/print` and the legacy security-profiles menu
both return the key in clear text, so every read is proplist-scoped and no proplist names a
credential field. The edit form leaves the box empty, where blank means "leave the current one
alone", and the audit trail records SET or UNSET rather than a value.

Four bugs surfaced only by running against real hardware, two of them only when a write was actually
executed against a router. They are listed under Fixed because that is what they were.

### Added
- **Wifi Networks page.** Every radio and SSID the router broadcasts, one row per interface grouped
  under the radio carrying it, with colour-coded SSID pills, band, security mode, VLAN and live
  client count. Works on **both** RouterOS wireless stacks — modern `/interface/wifi` and legacy
  `/interface/wireless` — and offers exactly the one the router has.
- **Editing, in place.** Change an SSID, passphrase, band, width, hidden flag or VLAN; enable and
  disable as one-click row actions; add an extra SSID to an existing radio and remove it again. A
  physical radio is editable but never removable, because it is hardware.
- **CAPsMAN configuration card.** Five RouterOS menus behind one tab strip — Provisioning,
  Configuration, Security, Channel and Datapath — all editable, with provisioning reorderable because
  the first matching rule wins.
- **Two new write guards.** Changing an SSID or passphrase on the interface MikroDash is reached
  through now warns before it drops every client on that radio. Overriding a
  `/interface/wifi/configuration` profile that more than one radio shares asks first, because the
  override silently splits two things that had been moving together — and it stays quiet when the
  profile is used by only one radio, since a warning that fires on the innocent case is one people
  learn to click through.
- **A CAPsMAN edit says what it will reach.** Saving a profile a live provisioning rule references
  warns that it is pushed to every CAP the moment you save, naming the rules and the CAP count. It is
  silent for a profile nothing enabled references.

### Changed
- **The Wireless pages are now Wifi Clients and Wifi Networks.** Display names only: every key,
  permission and saved setting is untouched, so no role grant or per-router override moves. The
  reasoning, and what a future key rename would have to migrate, is written up in `AI_CONTEXT.md`.
- **A resource may declare more than one guard.** They answer different questions and one write can
  trip several; the first warning wins, so a save never raises two dialogs in a row.
- **CAPsMAN and Wifi Networks reset on a router switch.** The CAPsMAN page had no such handler and
  could have offered an edit form against another device's rows once it became editable.

### Fixed
- **A router provisioning its own radios showed twelve uneditable rows and no reason.** RouterOS
  reports those interfaces as `dynamic` with **no** `configuration.manager`, so keying the badge on
  the manager alone left every row read-only in silence. Rows now say whether they are CAP-managed or
  locally provisioned.
- **Band and channel width were empty on every row.** Both live on the channel *profile* rather than
  on the interface. They are now resolved profile-first, then inferred from the frequency, then from
  the interface name.
- **Every edit of a wireless network failed**, whether or not it touched the VLAN. A field marked
  clearable emits an empty value on save, and RouterOS refuses an empty value for a typed integer:
  `invalid value for datapath.vlan-id, an integer required`.
- **An empty RouterOS menu answers with one nameless junk row**, which would have been read as a
  profile named `''` — exactly what an interface naming no profile looks up.

## [0.7.31] — Collectors that know when to stop, and a Backups page you can work in

A collector with nothing to report now **stops holding a channel open**, and says so on the card
instead of counting down to a fault it does not have. Concurrent open channels, not data volume, are
what strain small hardware, so a router with no WireGuard peers and no NetWatch hosts stops paying for
both. It wakes on its own: the moment you open the page, when the router reconnects, or on a slow
re-probe that backs off to ten minutes.

Chasing that turned up three real bugs on the smallest hardware, all the same shape. **An empty result
looked identical to a dead one.** On a streaming channel RouterOS answers an empty table with `!empty`,
which MikroDash deliberately swallows because on a stream it means "nothing yet" rather than "nothing".
The cost was that a cAP AX with connection tracking off restarted its Connections stream every 20
seconds, forever, and reported the stream degraded while doing it.

### Added
- **Collector dormancy.** A collector whose data is empty, or whose menu the router does not have,
  suspends itself and the card says "nothing to report" rather than going stale. Unsupported and
  merely-empty are treated differently: a command error is durable and sleeps for ten times as long as
  an empty table, which is transient. Nothing is hidden and nothing is dimmed, because an empty card
  that already reads "No devices" needs no second opinion.
- **Every collector can be switched off per router.** The Router Settings toggle grid had drifted to
  11 toggles against 21 disableable collectors, so Topology, VLANs, PPP, Bridges, CAPsMAN, DNS,
  Packages, WAN, Queues and Router Users could only be turned off by hand-editing `routers.json`. The
  grid is generated from the collector registry now, so it cannot drift again.
- **Backup time.** Choose the hour a scheduled backup runs, in your display timezone, instead of
  whenever the interval happens to elapse. Defaults to 08:00. Clearing the field is a real choice and
  means "any time", which keeps the old interval behaviour.
- **Delete restore points.** A selection column on the Backups history, with Delete acting on one or
  many. Delete removes the files and the row; the Audit page keeps the record of both the backup and
  its deletion.
- **The backup ID** is shown in its own column, so the id an audit entry names is readable rather
  than something to dig out of the page.

### Fixed
- **Connections restarted its stream forever on a router with an empty connection table.** The
  watchdog could not tell a quiet stream from a dead one, so an access point with tracking off took a
  restart every 20 seconds. It now asks the router once, on a one-shot request where an empty answer
  is unambiguous, before tearing anything down.
- **Top Talkers went stale on a router with no Kid Control devices.** It only produced a payload when
  the device list changed, so a table that was empty and stayed empty produced nothing at all. It also
  had no heartbeat while advertising a poll interval, which held its card to a deadline nothing was
  going to meet.
- **A "this router has no Kid Control" verdict never stuck.** Three separate paths cleared it, so the
  probe reopened on every browser reconnect and every idle wake-up. Its retry backoff was also a flat
  60 seconds that never grew, despite claiming to be exponential.
- **The Audit page Target column showed the word "router"** instead of the router's name, and the
  CSV/PDF export carried a bare uuid in its router column. Both name the device now. A router deleted
  since the event keeps the generic marker in the table and the id in the export, where a dangling
  reference still has to be followable.
- **An empty payload left the previous router's rows on screen.** Top Talkers and the LAN overview
  both treated "the router reports nothing" as "nothing changed", so after a router switch the card
  kept showing the other device's data, invisible to the stale timer.

### Changed
- **The Wireless page is now Wireless Clients**, and no longer shares both its name and its icon with
  the Wireless section holding it. The section keeps the wifi symbol; the page takes the signal bars,
  which is what it actually lists. Only labels changed: every key, permission and saved setting is
  untouched.
- **Restore moved to the Backups header**, beside Delete and Back Up Now, and is coloured apart from
  both. It acts on the selection and needs exactly one restore point, since "which of these three?"
  has no answer.
- **Dragging a firewall rule leaves its original position open**, tinted, so you can put it back if
  you change your mind. Dropping onto that gap returns the rule to where it started.

### Upgrading
Nothing to do. Dormancy is automatic and reversible; a collector wakes as soon as it has data.

Backup time is the one behaviour change worth knowing: a router whose backup schedule predates this
release has no time recorded, so it moves to **08:00** rather than staying wherever its interval had
drifted to. Clear the field on the Backups page to keep the old any-time behaviour.

## [0.7.30] — Configuration backups, scheduled email reports, and router writes across the app

MikroDash can now **back up and restore router configurations**, **email reports on a schedule**, and
**write configuration** from most of the pages that previously only read it.

The **Backups** page keeps a pair per restore point: a gzipped `/export` for diffing and an encrypted
`.backup` for restoring. A pair is written **only when the configuration actually changed**, so a daily
schedule costs a short check rather than disk, and drift is shown as a diff naming the exact lines that
moved. Restore pushes the binary back to the router and reboots it, behind a serial match, a typed
router name and a version-mismatch warning.

Getting there turned up a **silent data-corruption bug in the RouterOS connection**. The receiver
decoded every API word as UTF-8, which is right for text and destroys a binary: each invalid byte
became a replacement character, one per byte, so a file came back the *right length* and the wrong
content. Encoding is now a property of the connection. The mirror bug was worse in an app that has
just learned to write: outgoing words were still encoded as win1252, so a Cyrillic comment typed into
the new editors reached the router as `???????`.

### Added
- **Scheduled email reports.** A sixth tab on the Reports page schedules a report to be emailed
  daily, weekly or monthly, to a list of addresses that need no MikroDash account. Each report
  carries a PDF per section, complete with the same charts and stat boxes the on-screen export
  produces. Periods are real calendar periods in your timezone, so a monthly report covers *August*
  rather than a rolling thirty days that shifts every time the container restarts. Recipients go in
  Bcc, because they are frequently different customers who should not see each other's addresses.
  Requires the new **Scheduled reports** permission, which a role gets by holding *write* on
  Reports; anyone who can already export a report can see what is scheduled, because a mail-out
  nobody can see is the bad case.
- **Backups page.** Per-router schedule (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly — daily by default), manual
  runs, retention by count and by age, and a full run history including the checks that found nothing
  changed. The newest restore point is never pruned, however old it is: a router whose configuration
  has been stable would otherwise age out its only backup precisely because nothing went wrong.
- **Drift diffs.** A unified diff between any stored backup and the one before it, with the volatile
  export header stripped so an unchanged router never reports as drifted.
- **Restore.** Pushes the encrypted backup back to the router and loads it. Refused outright if the
  serial does not match the device the backup came from; warns once if the RouterOS version differs,
  because that is the restore you most want after a bad upgrade; requires the router's name to be
  typed; audited before the command is sent, because the reboot takes the answer with it.
- **Write access across the app** (#97). Add, edit and remove routes, static DNS entries, DHCP leases
  and networks, VLANs, bridges and bridge ports, VETH interfaces and WireGuard peers, each from the
  card that already showed them.
- **Firewall writes**, including **drag-and-drop reordering** with undo and redo. Position is recorded
  as the rule a row sat before, never an index, so an undo still means something after the table has
  moved on.
- **Update button** on the Dashboard's System card when a RouterOS update is available, with a typed
  confirmation and a progress state that stays on screen while the router reboots.
- Backup notifications for drift and failure. A run that changed nothing is deliberately not
  notifiable.

### Fixed
- **Binary files came back corrupted from RouterOS.** `/file/read` returns raw bytes and the receiver
  decoded them as UTF-8, replacing each invalid byte with U+FFFD. Because that is one character per
  byte, the reassembled file matched the reported size exactly and looked correct. Verified against a
  live hAP AX3: a known blob returned with a different sha256 and 177 of its 256 distinct byte values
  intact. The decode is now per connection, and only the backup transport asks for raw bytes.
- **Non-ASCII text was mangled on the way to the router.** Outgoing API words were encoded as win1252,
  which cannot represent Cyrillic, Greek or CJK, so they were substituted with `?` before leaving the
  process. This only started to matter when MikroDash learned to write.
- **Traffic kept flowing to a socket whose router access had been revoked.** The revocation sweep
  stops data by making the socket leave its rooms, which is correct for every collector except
  traffic — that one emits straight to each subscriber. A revoked session carried on receiving a
  sample per second until it happened to disconnect.
- Backups no longer refuse on small routers. A fixed 8 MB free-space threshold, extrapolated from one
  busy AX3, refused a hAP ac2 whose entire backup is 46 KB. Backup size tracks configuration, not
  hardware, so the router is asked instead of guessed at.
- The Audit page's timestamps could keep an ISO `T` separator that the Reports page stripped.

### Changed
- The Update button sits on the right edge of the update banner and matches its colour, instead of
  sitting in the middle of it in blue.
- The upgrade dialog no longer closes the moment the router accepts the command. That was exactly the
  moment worth explaining, so it now holds a spinner and says the router will be unreachable for a
  minute or two.

### Upgrading
Nothing to do. Backups are **off by default** and start no process until enabled per router, and no
report is scheduled until you create one.

Two things worth knowing if you use the Reports page today. The PDF export now caps its table at
5,000 rows, with a note in the document saying so: samples are stored one minute apart, so an
unaggregated month was a thousand-page document rendered on the same event loop that serves your
live dashboards. The CSV export is unchanged and still uncapped. Scheduled reports also need SMTP
configured under Settings → Notifications; the page says so when you create one rather than leaving
you to find out from a failed run.

Enabling them needs the RouterOS user to hold the **`ftp`** policy, which the recommended read-only
group denies: `/export file=` and `/system/backup/save` write files, and without it a backup fails
with `not enough permissions (9)`. This does not enable the FTP service. See RouterOS Setup in the
README.

Backups are stored under `/data/config-backups/<router>/` and are deliberately unreachable from both
the retention sweep and router deletion. Removing a router is exactly when its last known-good
configuration matters most.

## [0.7.25] — Nine new pages, a grouped sidebar, and a full audit trail

The biggest release so far. MikroDash gains **nine pages** — VLANs, PPP, Bridges, DNS, CAPsMAN,
Packages, Queues, Router Users and WAN — and with two dozen pages the flat sidebar had run out of
room, so it now **collapses into categories**. Every write action MikroDash performs, on itself or on a
router, is recorded in a new **Audit** trail.

**Three pages can now change router configuration**, which is new territory for a dashboard that
until recently only read. Each one is built around the specific way it could go wrong. Packages
schedules changes rather than applying them, and keeps the reboot behind a typed confirmation.
Queues warns before writing a limit that would throttle the dashboard's own traffic. Router Users
structurally refuses to touch the account MikroDash signs in with, or its group, because that is the
one edit that could lock the dashboard out of the router with no way back. WAN warns before a lease
action that would interrupt the very path a router is being managed through.

**None of it is on by default.** Every router-write page needs the RouterOS user to hold `write`
(and `policy` for Router Users), which the recommended read-only group deliberately denies. The
README documents the opt-in tier and what granting it means.

### Added
- **WAN page.** The uplinks RouterOS reports as internet-connected, in detail: which one is carrying
  traffic, default-route distance and failover order, public versus private addressing, live rates,
  and DHCP lease status with the countdown to renewal. Renew and Release with write access.
- **Queues page.** Simple queues and queue trees, kept in the router's own order because simple
  queues are first-match-wins and sorting would misrepresent them. Create, edit, reorder, enable,
  disable, reset counters and remove. A **FastTrack banner** explains the usual reason a queue looks
  configured and does nothing: FastTracked connections bypass simple queues entirely.
- **Router Users page.** RouterOS's own users, groups with the full 17-permission matrix, and the
  sessions logged in right now.
- **Audit page.** Every write action in one searchable trail — actor, source address, what changed,
  and whether it was allowed. Refusals are recorded as well as successes. Credential values never
  are; the field name and the fact it changed do. CSV export.
- **CAPsMAN, Bridges, DNS and Packages pages**, and **VLANs** and **PPP** pages.
- **Collapsible sidebar categories.** Twenty-three pages fold into seven groups — Network, Wireless,
  IP Services, Tunnels, Traffic, Security, System — with Dashboard, Routers, Reports, Audit and
  Settings always at the top level. Which groups are open is remembered against your account, not
  your browser. Turn it off in Settings → Appearance, or in the account dialog if your role has no
  Settings access.
- **Canned view presets** — Home, Standard and Advanced — as a bulk editor for Visible Pages and for
  a role's page matrix. A preset can only narrow what an install shows, never widen what a role
  permits.
- **WiFi Frequency Analyzer** on the Wireless page: RouterOS's own frequency scan, with a per-channel
  congestion grid and spectrum chart. The one deliberately disruptive thing MikroDash does, so it is
  gated, time-boxed and stopped when the person who started it leaves.

### Fixed
- **VLANs and PPP never started.** `buildSession()` returned every collector except those two, so
  startup threw partway through and silently abandoned every collector after them. A drift guard now
  reads the source and fails if the session omits one.
- **BGP alerts only evaluated for the router you had open.** The headless alert pool built no routing
  collector, so every other router produced none — a feature that reads as enabled in Settings and
  does nothing.
- **`!empty` closed streaming channels.** RouterOS 7 answers a command with no results yet with a
  bare `!empty`, which closed the channel rather than yielding an empty batch.
- **Polling profiles wrote `undefined` into seven sliders**, rendering `NaNms`. Nothing failed; the
  page quietly lied.
- **Page-scoped collectors kept polling from the Dashboard** — four every 5 s, plus six idle
  `/listen` channels held open for pages nobody was viewing. They now suspend when you are not on
  their page and refresh the moment you return.
- **Wireless hostname resolution** now says when it cannot work, instead of showing blanks: a router
  that bridges its clients at layer 2 holds no ARP entry to resolve them from.
- The test suite reported a different number of tests on every run — four suites never stopped the
  collectors they created, so the process was killed before it finished reporting.

### Changed
- **Poll Intervals** sliders now sit on exactly two scales, 1s–30s for live data and 10s–10m for
  things that change when somebody edits the router, laid out in two columns. They had drifted to
  five different ranges, which made "how fast can this go" a per-slider surprise.
- **Routing page** adopts the card look, with its tabs inside the card frame and pinned table
  headers.
- Server-side interval bounds were widened where a slider needed it and **never narrowed**, so a
  per-router override you already saved is not silently reduced.

### Upgrading
Nothing to do. A database migration widens the per-user preference table to hold the sidebar state;
it copies every existing row and is safe to roll back, since an older build simply never reads the
new kind.

To use the write features, grant the RouterOS user `write` (and `policy` for Router Users) — see
**RouterOS Setup** in the README. Without it, those pages degrade to read-only and show the exact
command to run rather than failing silently.

## [0.7.8] — A map of your fleet, WiFi SSIDs, and alerts that clear

The Routers page gains a **Map** view plotting each router where it actually is, and the
Wireless page gains a **WiFi SSIDs** card listing every network a router broadcasts. The
rest of this release is fixes, several of them to things that looked like they worked.

**Locations resolve themselves.** A router's position comes from its WAN IP, using the
geo-IP data already bundled in the image — nothing is sent anywhere to resolve it, and the
strict CSP would block an outbound lookup regardless. Pick a city or town by hand on any
router or site to override it. Accuracy is city-level at best, so the map answers "which
site is dark" rather than "which building".

### Added
- **Routers → Map view.** Each router as a dot coloured by connection state, clustered when
  several share a location and sized by how many, with a tray for routers whose location is
  not known so they are never silently dropped. Pan, zoom, Auto Frame to fit every router,
  and reset. Country borders only: place names appear only where a router sits, because
  labelling everything buried the thing you came to look at.
- **Router and site locations.** A city/town picker in router settings and when creating a
  site. Routers fall back to their site's location, so giving a whole location one position
  is enough. Set nothing and the WAN IP still answers.
- **Wireless → WiFi SSIDs card.** Every network the router broadcasts, with its bands and
  live client count. Read from the interface table rather than from connected clients, so a
  network with nobody on it is still listed — usually the one you opened the card to
  explain. A CAP whose configuration comes from a manager says so instead of reporting
  nothing. Passphrases are never read, let alone sent.
- **Routing page tabs.** The route and BGP tables are now tabbed, opening on Routes. The
  protocol doughnut and BGP session summary stay above the tabs, since they describe the
  page rather than one protocol.
- **Alerts carry the device name** and read as names rather than database keys —
  "Update Available" instead of `routeros_update`.

### Fixed
- **"Clear all" in the notification bell never cleared anything.** It acknowledged alerts,
  which empties the bell, but the Routers page counts alerts that are *unresolved* — so a
  router stayed marked **Alerting** no matter how many times you clicked. It now resolves as
  well, and records who did it. History is kept: nothing is deleted, and Reports still shows
  what happened. This is the only way to clear an alert whose cause disappeared without
  MikroDash ever seeing it recover.
- **The same alert fired over and over.** The evaluator kept "already reported" in memory,
  and that memory is wiped whenever a router's session is rebuilt — most often when nobody
  has looked at it for a while. Each rebuild re-reported every still-true condition, so a
  pending RouterOS update rang the bell repeatedly. At most one unresolved alert per router,
  type and subject now, enforced in the database so it survives restarts and router
  switches.
- **The Connections card could come up stale after a restart and stay that way.** A browser
  reconnecting while the router session was still being built hit a guard that dropped the
  resume, and nothing retried it. Connections was the only card affected, because it is the
  only one that opens its stream on resume rather than on start.
- **The WiFi SSIDs card was slow to populate and showed no bands or counts.** Two separate
  faults, both introduced with the card: a CAPsMAN probe was clearing the SSID list on every
  router without a `/caps-man` menu, and bands and client counts were frozen at the
  five-minute configuration refresh instead of following the live client table.

### Changed
- Site locations are set with the same city/town picker as routers, replacing raw latitude
  and longitude fields.

### Upgrading
Automatic. Migration v10 adds three columns to the sites table and runs at startup inside a
transaction. Existing site coordinates are preserved and keep working; re-pick a site's
location only if you want it to show a place name. No configuration changes.

## [0.7.7] — Personal alert channels, a My Account page, and a Routers overview

Alerting had one destination for the whole install. Since roles arrived that stopped
matching reality: two people can be scoped to different sites and still share one inbox.
Each user can now add their own Telegram, Pushbullet, ntfy or email destination, delivered
in addition to the install-wide channels — and is only ever notified about routers their
role lets them read.

**The rule that matters:** a user is never told about a router they cannot see. That is
checked at the moment the alert is sent, not when the channel is saved, so revoking
someone's access stops their notifications immediately with nothing to invalidate.

**Off by default.** A personal ntfy topic or SMTP recipient is an address the *user*
chooses, so enabling this widens what an ordinary account can make the server connect to.
Turn it on with **Allow personal channels** in Settings → Notifications. Nothing changes
for an install that leaves it alone.

### Added
- **My Account**, reached from your name in the sidebar. Change your own password — the
  first self-service credential change in MikroDash, and it signs out your other sessions —
  review the roles and scopes you hold, see and revoke your active sessions, and manage
  your own notification channels. Previously the only way to change a password was to ask
  an administrator.
- **Per-user notification channels** — Telegram, Pushbullet and ntfy with your own
  credentials; email as an opt-in plus an address, sent through the install's mail server.
  Which alert types fire stays an administrator's decision; you choose only where yours go.
- **Routers page summary** — Total Devices, Online, Offline and Alerting. Alerting counts
  routers with an unresolved alert, so it overlaps the online/offline split rather than
  partitioning it: a reachable router can still have something wrong on it.
- **Routers page views** — Comfortable and Compact card grids, and a List view: a sortable
  table of status, name, host, model, RouterOS, alerts, CPU/RAM/Disk, clients, WAN Rx/Tx
  and uptime. One search box narrows either view by name, host, model or version, and
  understands `online`, `offline` and `alerting`. The choice is remembered between visits.

### Fixed
- **The Interface Alert Filter stopped filtering the notification bell.** Unticking
  Wireless silenced the push and still rang the bell on every wlan flap. The install-wide
  alert-type toggles are authoritative again: a type switched off is not detected,
  recorded, belled or sent, for anyone.
- **The username and sign-out button vanished for every non-admin role.** The sidebar chip
  shares its markup with a nav item, so the role-based nav sweep hid it for everyone
  without Settings access — leaving no way to sign out at all short of clearing the cookie.
  Present since 0.7.5.
- **Cards showed stale after navigating away and back.** Leaving a page drops its data
  subscriptions, but the stale timers kept counting, so Connections and Top Talkers were
  marked stale on return and healed a few seconds later. The elapsed time was measuring how
  long the browser was not listening, not the collector.
- **The Settings page is now closed to non-admins**, not merely hidden from the nav. It had
  no permission check at all, so it could be opened from the browser console with every
  field editable. Every write was already refused by the server; the page had no business
  drawing.
- **Two dialogs that reported success on failure** — "Reset to defaults" and the alert-type
  toggles both claimed a change had landed without checking whether the server accepted it.

### Changed
- Per-user alert-type and interface-type filters were removed. Which alerts exist is one
  decision, made once by an administrator; a per-user copy let an end user widen their own
  alerting.
- The sidebar count pills are gone, along with the two socket events that fed them. The
  same counts remain on the pages they describe.
- The Routers page header ("Live overview of all configured routers") is replaced by a
  toolbar holding the search box and view selector.

### Upgrading
Automatic. Migration v9 adds one table for per-user channel settings and runs at startup
inside a transaction. No configuration changes, and the feature stays off until enabled.

## [0.7.6] — Switching routers keeps the dashboard live

Switching from one router to another left the browser subscribed to nothing. Connections and Top
Talkers kept showing the router you had just left, and then went stale — while their sidebar badges
carried on ticking, which is exactly what made it look like the connection was healthy.

Nothing to do on upgrade; no settings or data change.

### Fixed
- **Connections and Top Talkers now follow a router switch.** Room names are per-router, and a
  switch moved the browser into the new router's base room only — so the two collectors that emit
  *only* into page and card rooms went on delivering into rooms the browser had just left. The
  lightweight counts behind the nav badges ride the base room, which is why they kept updating while
  the cards did not. The browser now re-joins its page and dashboard-card rooms whenever the active
  router changes, through the ordinary focus handlers, so a role is re-evaluated against the new
  router rather than carried over from the old one.
- **A switch under the default (modern) auth mode now resets the dashboard.** Every browser-side
  reset hung off an event only the legacy `authMode: 'none'` path ever emitted, so on a normal
  install none of them fired: cleared card rows, the connections map's country counts, and the
  traffic and bandwidth charts all kept the previous router's state. Both switch paths now announce
  themselves, and the reset is sent before the new router's first payload so it cannot wipe it.

## [0.7.5] — Custom, page-scoped roles

A role used to be one of three names compiled into the source: `viewer`, `operator`, `admin`. That
can say *who* and *where* but not *what* — a viewer saw every page of every router they could reach,
and the only way to hide a page was a per-install toggle that applied to everyone equally. Roles are
rows now, and a role is a matrix of **page → read/write**, granted to a user or a group over
everything, one site, or a single router.

**Upgrading is automatic and changes nobody's access.** Migrations v7 and v8 run at startup, each in
its own transaction. Existing grants are mapped onto three seeded roles that reproduce today's
behaviour exactly — **Read Only** deliberately has no Reports page, because a viewer holds
`router:read` and nothing else, and granting Reports would have handed every existing viewer
historical data and CSV exports they never had. **Administrator** is built in, carries no page rows
at all, and stays that way so a permission added in a future release is covered without another
migration. Read Only and Operator are ordinary roles you can edit.

**Back up `/data` before upgrading.** The `grants` table is rebuilt. Each migration is atomic, so a
failure rolls back rather than leaving a half-migrated table, but the usual advice applies. Rolling
back to 0.7.0 keeps working: the legacy `role` column survives as a write-only mirror, and v8 gives
`role_id` a least-privilege default so an older binary can still write grants instead of failing on
a NOT NULL constraint.

### Added
- **Roles** — Settings → Authentication → Access Management → Roles. A 14-row page matrix with a
  three-way None/Read/Write control per page. Write toggles are disabled on pages that have no write
  action yet, rather than hidden, so the matrix keeps its shape for issue #97.
- **Access Management** — Users, Groups, Sites and Roles now share one tabbed card that fills the
  viewport and scrolls internally. Add and edit open centre-screen dialogs instead of pushing the
  table down.
- Users are granted access the same way groups already were: rows of *role over scope*, so one
  person can hold different roles at different sites. The old single-role dropdown and
  all-or-listed-routers picker are gone.
- Permission changes reach open browsers live — editing a role no longer needs a reload.

### Changed
- Page visibility is now the conjunction of the install-wide toggle and the session's role. A page
  shows only if both allow it.
- Collectors deliver page-scoped payloads. Seven collectors were split so global chrome (sidebar
  counts, the traffic interface picker, WAN IP) still reaches every session while the page detail
  reaches only those permitted — a denied page no longer streams its data to the browser at all.
- `Users.adminCount()` was removed rather than left unused: a count of user records cannot see an
  administrator whose grant is held through a group. `Rbac.wouldOrphanGlobalAdmin()` answers instead.

### Fixed
- The Topology page visibility toggle never worked — the setting existed and the client read it, but
  the server neither persisted nor broadcast it.
- `.sbtn-outline` was referenced in a dozen places and never defined, so those buttons fell back to
  the browser's default grey instead of the theme.
- `/api/topology-layout` took a `routerId` with no authorization check, making it a cross-router
  probe for any signed-in session.
- `buildRouterIo`, `alertSessions` and `overviewSessions` each capped Socket.IO room chaining at two
  levels, throwing as soon as a collector needed three.

### Security
- System administration — users, groups, roles, sites — is reachable only by an Administrator at
  global scope. This is enforced in the resolver, which strips those permissions from any role
  however its page matrix is configured, so a site-scoped grant can never reach them.
- `POST /api/settings` now strips `authMode`, session timeout, credentials and `_reset` unless the
  caller can manage principals — otherwise a role holding Settings:write could disable authentication.
- Deleting the last administrator is refused across every path that can cause it, including removing
  the last member from a group that holds the grant.

### Known limitation
- Page permissions govern what the browser is sent, not what the router collects: collectors are
  shared per router across every viewer. Data for a denied page is not delivered, but a router a user
  can read is still collected in full.

## [0.7.0] — Per-router collection settings, and the poll path made real

Stream-vs-poll and collector enablement used to live once in `settings.json` and apply to every
router. A hAP ax3 runs all 16 collectors happily; a hAP ac2 acting as an access point received the
same ~17 concurrent streams for data it does not have, and the only way to calm one router was to
slow every router. Both now live on each router.

Measured on the ac2, not assumed: cutting the stream count took `traffic:update` from 28 to 93
events per 120 s. The evidence points at concurrent open channels rather than data volume, which is
why every pollable collector now ships both paths.

### Added

- **Per-router collection settings**, in the Add/Edit Router modal: a Stream/Poll master switch,
  enable/disable for 11 collectors, and interval overrides. Changing any of them rebuilds that one
  router's session; a label-only edit costs nothing.
- **Poll paths for eight more collectors** — arp, dhcpLeases, dhcpNetworks, firewall, netwatch,
  routing, vpn, wireless — so Poll genuinely means poll. Logs and the traffic graph stay streamed by
  design: polling `/log/print` drops entries between polls, and 1 s `monitor-traffic` polling is
  worse than one stream.
- **A neutral "collection disabled" scrim** on cards whose collector is switched off, so a disabled
  card no longer dims and reads as a fault.
- **RouterOS API keepalive**, which stops non-active routers reconnecting every ~17 s (#107).
- **Persistent stream failure is now reported** on the affected card instead of being restarted
  silently forever (#106).

### Changed

- **The global Collection Method setting is gone.** A one-shot migration maps the old global choice
  onto each router first, so an install running global Poll does not revert to Stream on upgrade.
  Global Poll Intervals stay as the fleet-wide default that per-router values override.
- **Settings always opens on the Routers tab** rather than restoring the last tab used.
- **The router Add/Edit modal is two columns** and no longer scrolls on a normal desktop window.
- **Streaming-first is reframed, not abandoned** — streaming remains the default; per-router polling
  is a supported escape hatch for constrained hardware.

### Fixed

- **Interface rates never updated in poll mode.** The poll filtered interfaces with
  `!iface.disabled`, but RouterOS sends `disabled` as the string `"false"` — truthy — so every
  interface was excluded and all rates sat at 0.00.
- **Ping and Top Talkers died permanently in poll mode** the first time every viewer disconnected:
  `suspend()` cleared the poll timer and `resume()` restarted only the stream.
- **Connections went silent when switching routers.** `resume()` runs before `start()` sets
  `_started`, so poll mode scheduled nothing. Stream mode hid this because its watchdog resurrects
  the stream; poll mode has no watchdog by design.
- **Page-gated cards were blank for a full interval** on every visit — 30 s for Wireless — because a
  poll loop armed its first timer an interval ahead instead of polling immediately.
- **A router's update info stayed blank after switching to it**, for up to `updateCheckHours`. The
  check's rate-limit slot is shared per router, so background sessions consumed the window and threw
  the answer away.
- **Dashboard cards kept the previous router's rows** after a switch. Nine cards were affected; Top
  Talkers was the visible one.
- **False bell notifications on switch.** The browser runs its own alert detectors, and they ignored
  each router's Alert Monitoring setting; `ifstatus:update` also carried no router id, so a late
  in-flight update from the outgoing router read as interfaces going down and back up.
- **A wireless collector could latch onto a command tree the board does not have** and never
  recover — a wifi-only board with its radios disabled answers empty, not with an error.
- **A settings save no longer overwrites a per-router interval override.**
- **The Routers page no longer polls every non-active router at 1 s** regardless of configuration.

### Notes for upgraders

The five `stream*` keys are removed from `settings.json`. The migration runs once at startup and
writes an equivalent `collection` block onto any router that needs one, so no action is required.
Per-router settings live in `/data/routers.json`; a router with no `collection` block streams, which
is the previous default.

## [0.6.1] — Settings layout, accessibility, and router identity columns

The Settings page used to sit in a 720 px column in the middle of the window, and it had grown long enough that finding anything meant scrolling past everything else. It now uses the full width. Alongside that: a keyboard-accessibility pass over the whole UI, and three new columns in the Routers table.

### Added

- **Model, Serial, and RouterOS version columns** in Settings → Routers. These are learned from RouterOS but stored against the router entry, so they stay populated for a router that is offline or disabled — which is the point of an inventory column. Version renders as a bare `7.23.3` in a violet pill.
- **Header sorting on the Wireless client table**, alongside the existing button bar rather than replacing it.
- **A visible keyboard focus ring** across the whole UI. There was none before, so tabbing gave no indication of position — a WCAG 2.4.7 failure.
- **40 `aria-label`s** on icon-only buttons, which previously announced nothing at all to a screen reader.

### Changed

- **Settings is full width**, laid out on a two-column grid with equal-height rows. Tables and the tallest cards span the full width. Measured against the old layout, the General tab is 37 % shorter and Notifications 24 % shorter at 1600 px.
- **The About tab keeps its original stacked, centred column** — its short blurbs read badly as wide, shallow bands.
- **Save Settings is pinned to the bottom** of the scroll container, so it stays reachable however long a tab gets.
- **Pushbullet and ntfy share a row** inside Notification Channels. Both are short, so a full-width row each was mostly empty; this takes 194 px off the card.
- **Router cards match heights** within a row instead of each sizing to its own content.

### Fixed

- **VPN peer alerts fired on the wrong transition.** The collector's peer state became a three-way `never` / `active` / `stale` in 0.5.54 without `alerter.js` being updated to match, so it compared against a boolean that no longer existed. Introduced in 0.5.54 and shipped for a full release.
- **The wireless sort indicator was invisible** — the arrow never rendered. The test that should have caught it asserted the CSS class rather than the rendered output.

### Notes for upgraders

This adds three optional string fields — `model`, `serial`, `osVersion` — to each entry in `/data/routers.json`. Existing files are untouched until a router connects and reports, and older builds ignore unknown fields, so a rollback is safe.

## [0.6.0] — Node 24, ARMv7 dropped, and a release pipeline that publishes on tags

First release with a breaking change, hence the minor bump rather than another 0.5.x. **If you run MikroDash on 32-bit ARM hardware, read the first section before upgrading.**

Everything else here is infrastructure: a Node 24 base image, a database driver that will not break on the next Node release, and a CI pipeline that stops publishing unreleased code as `latest`.

### Removed

- **`linux/arm/v7` images are no longer built.** MikroDash moved to a Node 24 base image and Node 24 dropped 32-bit ARM upstream, so the official image has no arm/v7 variant to build on. The build fails at image resolution, before any of our code compiles, and there is no flag around it:

  ```
  node:20-alpine   amd64, arm/v6, arm/v7, arm64/v8, ppc64le, s390x
  node:22-alpine   amd64, arm/v6, arm/v7, arm64/v8, s390x
  node:24-alpine   amd64, arm64/v8, s390x
  ```

  Releases now cover `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` only.

  **If you are on ARMv7** — a RouterOS container on 32-bit hardware such as the hEX S (2025), or an older 32-bit Raspberry Pi — pin to `ghcr.io/secops-7/mikrodash:0.5.54`, the last release built for you. It will not receive further updates, including security fixes. Do not stay on `:latest`, which now resolves to a manifest with no arm/v7 entry, so your pull will fail rather than degrade gracefully.

  Because this is a minor bump, **anyone pinned to `:0.5` is unaffected and stays on 0.5.54.** That was the reason for choosing 0.6.0 over 0.5.55.

  ARMv7 support was added in 0.5.43 for issue #44, which is reopened to track whether a separate ARMv7 build is worth maintaining. That depends on how many people are actually running one, so please comment there if this affects you.

### Changed

- **Base image is now `node:24-alpine`** (was `node:20-alpine`). Node 20 is past the end of its LTS maintenance window, and `geoip-lite` 2.x declares `engines: { node: '>=24' }`. npm only warns on an engine mismatch, so a future `geoip-lite` patch using a Node 24 API would have installed cleanly, passed CI and then failed to load in production. `package.json` now declares `engines: { node: '>=24.0.0' }` so the supported range is explicit rather than implied by the Dockerfile. Addresses #101

- **`better-sqlite3` 9.6.0 → 13.0.3.** The base image bump forced this: 9.6.0 does not compile against Node 24, whose V8 headers require C++20 (`v8config.h: error: "C++20 or later required."`) while 9.6.0's build config does not request it. Majors 10 through 12 were end-of-life Node drops rather than API changes.

  Version 13 is the first N-API build, which is the part that matters beyond this release: N-API is ABI-stable across Node majors, so a native module that fails to compile on the next Node is no longer a recurring hazard. It also removes 29 transitive build dependencies (`prebuild-install`, `bindings`, `tar-fs`, `tar-stream`, `node-abi`, `rc`, `simple-get` and others) that existed only to fetch and locate prebuilt binaries, in favour of a single `node-addon-api`.

  Verified against a populated production database rather than a fresh one: 312,189 rows reopened under the new driver with identical oldest-sample timestamps and both routers intact. Your data does not need migrating. **Downgrading back to 0.5.54 after upgrading is untested**, so take a copy of `/data` first if you want a guaranteed way back.

- **Container images are published on version tags only.** Previously the workflow ran on every push to `main` *and* on tags, and tagged `latest` unconditionally, so `latest` tracked unreleased work rather than the newest release. Anyone following the README's `docker pull ...:latest` was running whatever was last merged. Pushes to `main` still build every architecture as a check, they just publish nothing.

  This also fixes the failure that delayed 0.5.54: two builds racing to upload the same layers tripped a GHCR secondary rate limit. Cache writes are now restricted to tag builds, so a validation run performs no registry writes at all.

- **All GitHub Actions upgraded** to their Node 24 majors, since GitHub has deprecated the Node 20 action runtime: `actions/checkout` v4→v7, `docker/setup-qemu-action` and `docker/setup-buildx-action` v3→v4, `docker/login-action` v3→v4, `docker/metadata-action` v5→v6, `docker/build-push-action` v6→v7.

### Fixed

- **A `geoip-lite` load failure was silent.** It was required independently at three call sites, two of which swallowed the error into an empty `catch`. A failure left every geo lookup returning nothing, so the world map, country breakdowns and connection geo data quietly emptied out while the dashboard otherwise looked healthy — indistinguishable from a network with no traffic.

  `src/geo.js` is now the single load point: one require, one warning, and availability is reported in the API Diagnostics card as a `geo lookups / unavailable` row carrying the loader's reason. Part of #101

- **`node --test` invocation broken by Node 24.** The runner now treats a bare directory argument as a module to load and exits with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. The pre-push hook, the CI workflow and the documented command now pass a quoted `'/app/test/*.test.js'` glob. Contributors updating an existing checkout should note the pre-push hook lives in `.git/` and is not updated by pulling; re-copy it if your pushes start failing on a trivially empty suite.

### Notes

- Test suite is at 314, up from 311.
- No application behaviour changed in this release. Every user-visible feature is as it was in 0.5.54.

## [0.5.54] — Interface list view, VPN sessions, and honest bandwidth reports

Feature release built mostly out of open issues. The Interfaces page gains a table view that surfaces error and drop counters MikroDash has never read, VPN monitoring finally covers PPP and IPsec rather than WireGuard alone, and the Reports page stops conflating link speed with data volume.

Several of the fixes below were found while building the features rather than reported. Two are worth calling out because they were confidently wrong rather than merely missing: the bandwidth report's "peak" was a peak of averages, understating a real 938 Mbps spike as roughly 4 Mbps, and a WireGuard peer that vanished days ago still counted as connected.

### Added

- **List view on the Interfaces page** (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`). The card size control becomes a view picker — Compact, Comfortable, Large, List — and the table carries what a tile has no room for: cumulative RX/TX totals, error and drop counters, link flap count, and time since the link last came up. Every column sorts on click, types are colour-coded from the same palette the Interface Types card uses, and unknown values always sort last so a descending sort on Errors surfaces the faulty interfaces rather than burying them under the ones reporting no counter at all.

  Errors and drops are kept as separate columns rather than summed, because they mean different things: errors are link integrity faults (FCS, alignment, collisions), drops are discards (full queue, no buffer). A bad cable and a congested link are not the same problem.

  Lifetime counters are paired with a delta. A lifetime count of 656 says a fault happened at some point; it does not say whether it is still happening. The collector snapshots counters on each metadata tick and shows the movement since the previous one as a `+N` badge. A counter that goes backwards (reboot, or an explicit reset-counters) yields zero rather than a negative, and the baseline is dropped on reconnect so a reboot does not report a spurious spike.

  A counter an interface does not report emits `null` and renders as a dimmed dash, never as `0`. A WireGuard peer showing "0 errors" would imply a health check that is not happening.

  Collecting this needed a third metadata stream. Ethernet ports return `tx-queue-drop` but none of the rx/tx error counters — those live at PHY level on `/interface/ethernet` — so without it the Errors column would have been empty on exactly the ports where cabling faults show up. Roughly 4.5 KB/min extra on a 30-interface router, on the existing 60 s stream; the 1 s rate stream is untouched. Closes #56

- **Interface card sizes** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`). Compact, Comfortable and Large, persisted to `localStorage`. Everything scales from two custom properties, so a larger card shows more of a long name rather than rearranging the layout.

- **ISP view on Reports → Bandwidth Usage** (`src/db.js`, `src/index.js`, `public/app.js`). Link utilisation against the router's configured `bwDownMbps`/`bwUpMbps`, resolved server-side from the requested router so a report for router B is correct while router A is active. Deliberately **not** clamped at 100%: the live dashboard card clamps, which is exactly what hid that one test router's peak upload runs at 177% of its configured capacity. Over-capacity is flagged. Also adds a nearest-rank 95th percentile, a truncation hint when the chart shows fewer samples than the totals cover, dashed per-bucket peak lines, and an opt-in capacity reference line (off by default, because on a 1 Gbps link carrying a few Mbps it flattens the real curve onto the baseline). Closes #62

- **PPP and IPsec in VPN monitoring** (`src/collectors/vpn.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`). MikroDash watched WireGuard and nothing else. `/ppp/active` is where a genuine session uptime exists, and `/ip/ipsec/active-peers` joined to `/ip/ipsec/installed-sa` is where negotiated ciphers exist, so both are now answerable. `/ppp/secret` is deliberately never queried: it holds credentials, and the active list already carries everything worth showing. Both sections stay hidden unless the router has rows, so a WireGuard-only setup looks exactly as it did. Closes #64

- **Oxanium and Orbitron fonts** (`public/fonts/`, `public/css/app-fonts.css`), bringing the picker to 26 options. Latin-subset WOFF2 at weights 400/500/600/700. `public/fonts/OFL.txt` adds licence notices for every bundled family, fetched from upstream rather than retyped.

### Changed

- **Reports now distinguishes link speed from data volume.** The Bandwidth Usage tab was showing Mbps cards, which belong to Traffic History. Traffic History answers "how fast was the link"; Bandwidth Usage answers "how much data moved". The tabs no longer borrow each other's units.

- **VPN peer `uptime` renamed to `lastHandshake`.** It never held an uptime. WireGuard is stateless, so there is no session and no uptime to report, and the misleading name is most of why the issue asked for one.

- **Idle gating on the new VPN polls**, in three layers: they ride the existing page-visibility gate, a `no such command` response latches the subsystem off permanently, and a router that has the commands but no sessions backs off from 10 s to 60 s after three empty polls, resetting as soon as something appears.

### Fixed

- **Bandwidth report peak was a peak of averages** (`src/db.js`, `public/app.js`). SQL bucketed with `AVG()` and the browser took the maximum across buckets, so a real 938.3 Mbps spike displayed as roughly 4 Mbps on a daily view. Stat figures now come from SQL over the whole range instead of being reduced from returned rows.

- **Bandwidth totals were about 4.9% high.** `rx_mb` is written as `Mbps/8`, which is decimal, but was rendered against 1024-based thresholds. ISP quotas are decimal too. Browser totals will read slightly lower than before, and the bandwidth PDF's "Peak Download/Upload" changes unit from MB/min to Mbps.

- **Bandwidth totals were computed from truncated data**, under-reporting 171.8 GB (6.7%) at all-time because the rows had already been capped by `LIMIT 100000`. Fixed by the same move to SQL-side aggregation, which also retires a `Math.max.apply` stack-overflow risk on 100k-row arrays.

- **A VPN peer that vanished days ago still counted as connected** (`src/collectors/vpn.js`). `state` was derived from whether a peer had *ever* handshaken. The UI already graded the same value by age and drew it red, so the badge and the connected count actively contradicted each other. State now comes from handshake age using the thresholds the badge already used: active (under 3 minutes, matching WireGuard's rekey interval), stale, never. A separate Never Connected tile was added.

- **Long interface names slid underneath the tile sparkline** (`public/index.html`). The name had nowrap and ellipsis but measured against the full tile width, while the sparkline sits absolutely positioned over the top-right corner, so a name truncated at the tile edge instead of before the graph. Closes the display half of #56.

- **A long interface comment made its tile taller than its neighbours**, because `.iface-type` had no nowrap and wrapped to a second line.

- **Interfaces without an IP produced short rows.** The IP line was only rendered when an address existed, so a row of address-less interfaces came out a line shorter. The element is now always present with a blank placeholder, and the grid uses `grid-auto-rows:1fr`, so every tile matches the tallest and rate bars line up across the page.

- **`wifi` and `wg` were missing from the interface type palette** (`public/app.js`). RouterOS reports the newer drivers under those names rather than `wlan` and `wireguard`, so on current hardware the two most common types fell through to the rotating fallback colours in the Interface Types card. Fallback colours for genuinely unknown types are now hashed from the type name rather than assigned by position, so a type keeps its colour across renders.

- **`fmtBytes` had no terabyte tier**, so any counter past 1 TB rendered as a four-digit GB figure.

- **README overstated the Interfaces page**, claiming the tiles showed cumulative RX/TX totals. They never had — no byte-total field existed anywhere in the codebase. Corrected, and the List view now provides them.

### Security

- **Two `js/tainted-format-string` alerts resolved** (`src/collectors/dhcpLeases.js`, `src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`), both flagged high by CodeQL. Each concatenated the router label and an error message into `console`'s *first* argument, which Node treats as a format string, so a `%` in a router label could consume a later argument. Demonstrated rather than assumed: with a label of `[%s-evil][leases]` the old call swallowed the error message into the label position and the actual error vanished from the line. Both now use a constant format string with the values passed as arguments. Output for a normal label is byte-identical.

  Worth knowing for anyone auditing: the `// codeql[...]` comments scattered across the collectors are not suppressing anything. 75 further sites share the same concatenation pattern and most carry that comment, yet only these two were ever flagged, so CodeQL is finding them by dataflow and ignoring the comments. The remaining sites are mitigated in practice because the label is stripped of `%` at its source in `src/routeros/client.js`. A mechanical sweep would remove the class entirely.

### Notes

- **The PPP and IPsec paths are unverified against live data.** The development fleet is WireGuard-exclusive, so those tables are empty here. The transforms are covered by unit tests with synthetic rows and the frontend was verified by injecting a synthetic payload, but nothing has exercised them against a real L2TP session or IPsec SA. Reports welcome.

- Test suite is at 311, up from 283 at 0.5.53.

## [0.5.53] — Socket.IO parser security patch

Single-fix release, published so the patch below reaches a tagged image. It landed on `main` shortly after v0.5.52 was tagged, so the `0.5.52` image does not contain it. Upgrade if you are running `0.5.52` or earlier.

Nothing else changed.

### Security

- **socket.io-parser 4.2.7** (#102), closing a high severity advisory: [CVE-2026-69185](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2m8v-j782-fhvr), "Socket.IO: Zero-attachment Memory Exhaustion". A binary packet declaring zero attachments was accepted and could be used to exhaust memory. 4.2.7 rejects it — the decoder now refuses any attachment count below one, where previously only counts above the maximum were checked.

  This is a transitive dependency of `socket.io` and sits in the path of every packet MikroDash sends, so the upgrade was verified rather than taken on trust: the guard was confirmed present in the shipped code, the full suite passes against the upgraded tree, and the app was booted and driven in a browser with the socket connected and live data rendering.

## [0.5.52] — Data cleanup, DHCP lease filtering, a readable light theme

Housekeeping release. You can now delete stored history on demand instead of waiting for retention to catch up, filter DHCP leases by VLAN, and actually read the light theme.

Three of the fixes below were found while building the features rather than reported, and two of them were silently wrong in ways nobody would have noticed: `VACUUM` never reclaimed a single byte, and every recorded outage was shorter than the real one.

### Added

- **Data Cleanup** (`src/db.js`, `src/index.js`, Settings → Data Cleanup). Delete stored history on demand, scoped three ways: one router or all, by data type (traffic, ping, bandwidth, alerts and connectivity), and by age (1, 7, 30, 90, 365 days, or everything). The card shows current database size, total rows and a per-router breakdown, and a Preview tells you exactly how many rows a selection would remove before you commit to it — the preview runs the same predicate as the delete, so the two cannot disagree. The database is compacted afterwards so the space is genuinely returned to disk. Admin only, and a restricted admin cannot run a global purge, because that would delete history for routers they cannot see. Closes #77
- **DHCP lease filtering** (`src/collectors/dhcpLeases.js`, DHCP page). Filter the lease table by DHCP server, with the interface and VLAN shown as context on each option, for example `IoT DHCP · IoT · VLAN 10 (27)`. The issue asked for three separate filters — interface, server and VLAN — but on a real configuration they are the same axis: a DHCP server binds to exactly one interface and that interface is the VLAN, so all three select an identical set. One control covers all three. It composes with the existing text search, so you can search within a single VLAN. Leases now carry their server, interface and VLAN, joined from `/ip/dhcp-server` and `/interface/vlan`. Closes #65
- **Redesigned router picker** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`). The topbar `<select>` is replaced by a popover listing each router with its host and a live status dot, so you can see what is online *before* switching rather than after. The active router carries a check mark, and a search box appears once you have five or more routers, matching on both label and host. Full keyboard support and ARIA listbox semantics. The mobile nav deliberately keeps its native select, because the OS picker is the better control on touch. Closes #72

### Fixed

- **The light theme failed WCAG AA everywhere** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`). All nine light palettes failed on muted text, between 1.65:1 and 2.97:1 against a 4.5:1 requirement, and cards barely separated from the page behind them at 1.06:1 to 1.16:1. Solarized also failed on main body text at 3.45:1. Muted text is now opaque and lands near 4.8:1 in every palette, main text is at least 8:1, borders reach about 1.9:1, and page backgrounds are darkened a step so cards read as cards. The default light palette was additionally inheriting dark-mode accent colours, which is why the version badge and tagline washed out. Dark mode is untouched. Closes #71
- **`VACUUM` reclaimed nothing** (`src/db.js`). MikroDash runs SQLite in WAL mode, so the pages freed by a delete sit in the write-ahead log until a checkpoint — leaving `VACUUM` with nothing to compact and the file on disk exactly as large as before. Measured directly: 925,696 bytes before, unchanged after `VACUUM`, then 8,192 bytes once a `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` ran first. This also means the existing daily retention prune would never have returned space to the filesystem once it started firing
- **Every outage was reported shorter than it was** (`src/db.js`, `src/db-writer.js`, `src/index.js`, `src/alertSessions.js`). MikroDash waits `connDownThresholdSec` (30 seconds by default) before declaring a router down, so a brief blip is not logged as an outage. That part is correct. The mistake was writing the database row only when that timer expired, while the insert stamped the current time itself — so the stored timestamp was when the outage was *declared*, not when the router actually dropped. Since downtime is measured by pairing offline and online events, every outage came out short by the threshold: about 5% error on a ten-minute outage, 67% on a 45-second one. Existing records keep their original timestamps. Closes #99
- **An idle tab sat on an empty dashboard instead of returning you to the login page** (`public/app.js`). Once a session was gone — expired, or wiped by a container restart, since sessions are held in memory — the Socket.IO handshake was refused with a 401 and the client retried it silently forever. All three existing redirect paths were structurally unable to fire in that state: the session check lived inside the `connect` handler and so needed the very connection being refused, the expiry event needs a live socket, and the 401 interceptor only wraps `fetch` while Socket.IO polls over `XMLHttpRequest`. A `connect_error` handler now confirms with the server before redirecting, so a genuinely dead session sends you to the login page while a transient outage leaves you where you are
- **The lease list dropped fields on first connect** (`src/index.js`). Initial state rebuilt the DHCP lease payload by hand instead of replaying the collector's own, which silently discarded any field the collector added — the new server summary among them

### Changed

- **The About tab's License card** is replaced by a green MIT License label on the header card, linking to the repository licence. The full MIT grant, copyright notice and warranty paragraphs were quoted inline; a link says the same thing without the wall of text. The MikroTik trademark disclaimer stays, because it is doing real protective work for a third-party project using those names. Closes #74
- **The Sign In button** now uses Inter 700. It asked for weight 700 but Syne ships only 400, 600 and 800, so the browser rounded up to 800 and rendered heavy and cramped for a UI control
- **Dependency updates**: geoip-lite 2.0.3, express-rate-limit 8.6.1, ip-address 10.4.0 (#100). geoip-lite 2.x declares Node 24 while the image is built on Node 20; verified before merging that it installs, loads and looks up correctly on Node 20, that the full suite passes, and that the app boots with live geo lookups working. Geo data is fresher as a result. Tracked in #101

## [0.5.51] — Stream recovery, accurate connectivity history, self-explaining offline routers

Two separate "it says offline but it isn't" reports turned out to be different bugs, and both are fixed.

Most of the stream recovery and collector freshness work in this release was contributed by **[@invoker-karl](https://github.com/invoker-karl)** in [#91](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/pull/91). Thank you.

### Fixed

- **Phantom router outages after a switch or idle teardown** (`src/index.js`). Tearing a session down cancelled the pending offline debounce timer and then closed the API connection, but the resulting `close` event arrived *after* that cancel and armed a fresh 30 second timer which nothing cancelled. It then recorded an Offline event and fired a router down alert for a router that was never unreachable. Every router switch, idle teardown, disable and delete took this path, so the Connectivity report accumulated outages that showed as "Ongoing", because the torn down session never reconnects and no closing row was ever written. With alerts enabled it also produced bogus notifications. Closes #84
- **Silently stalled traffic streams** (`src/collectors/traffic.js`). A persistent RouterOS stream can stay attached while delivering nothing, leaving the graph frozen after a few seconds while the app still reports as connected. A watchdog now restarts the stream after ten seconds without data. Addresses #90 and #55 (#91, @invoker-karl)
- **Collector freshness was never checked** (`src/health.js`, `src/index.js`). `/healthz` only tested the parent RouterOS connection, so a dead collector still looked healthy. It now validates that critical collectors are delivering fresh data, while excluding collectors intentionally suspended because nobody is viewing them (#91, @invoker-karl)
- **Interface rate poll failures were suppressed** (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`). Errors were swallowed while `_buildAndEmit()` kept advancing `lastIfStatusTs`, so a broken collector reported itself healthy. Failures are now recorded and no longer advance the freshness timestamp (#91, @invoker-karl)
- **Traffic health froze with no browser connected** (`src/collectors/traffic.js`). The collector's timestamps were updated after the idle gate, so a perfectly healthy stream looked stale to `/healthz` on an idle dashboard (#91, @invoker-karl)
- **Idle interfaces reporting numeric zero counters** were discarded as empty packets, and are now treated as valid samples (#91, @invoker-karl)

### Added

- **Offline routers explain themselves** (`src/routeros/classifyError.js`, `public/app.js`). The Routers page now shows why a router is unreachable, for example "Connection refused", "Authentication failed" or "Network unreachable", instead of a bare "Offline". The classifier was extracted from `wireRosEvents()` so the status only sessions produce identical wording, which is what makes the reason available for routers you are not currently viewing. Numeric error codes are resolved too: node-routeros wraps socket failures in a `RosException` carrying only an errno, so a refused connection previously surfaced as an opaque `RouterOS API error [-111]`. Closes #92
- **Heartbeat emissions for unchanged data** (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`, `src/collectors/bandwidth.js`), so a stable reading is not mistaken by the browser for a dead collector (#91, @invoker-karl)
- **Tests run on every pull request** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`). Builds the production image, runs the full suite inside it and smoke tests startup. Previously only CodeQL ran on pull requests

### Security

- **Router labels are sanitised at their source** (`src/routeros/client.js`). The label is the origin of the `[label][collector]` log prefix and is attacker influenceable, because the system collector adopts the device's own board name while the label is still the default. Control characters, which could forge whole log lines, and `%`, which could act as a format specifier, are now stripped at the single point the value enters
- **Dependency updates**: body-parser 1.20.6, brace-expansion 1.1.16, js-yaml 4.3.0 (#89)

### Changed

- `stream(command, params, callback)` is now explicitly supported by the RouterOS wrapper rather than relying on a quirk of the vendored driver (#91, @invoker-karl)
- `AI_CONTEXT.md` documents the standing CodeQL dismissals and the logger invariant behind them
- `README.md` describes the stricter `/healthz` behaviour

### Contributors

- [@invoker-karl](https://github.com/invoker-karl) — traffic stream watchdog, collector freshness checks in `/healthz`, interface poll error reporting, heartbeat emissions, zero-counter handling and explicit three-argument `stream()` support ([#91](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/pull/91))

## [0.5.50] — Security & stability hardening, collector refactor

Full-codebase review remediation: 17 P1 bugs fixed across security and stability, plus the first round of the planned refactors.

### Security

- **RBAC**: `routers:stats`, `router:status` replay and `/api/localcc` now respect `allowedRouterIds` — restricted viewers no longer receive host/serial/license/version/cpu (or the WAN IP) for routers outside their allowed set (`src/index.js`)
- **Auth mode split-brain fixed**: new `_authMode()`/`_isModern()` helpers replace six call sites that defaulted to the removed `'basic'` mode — a falsy `authMode` could previously hand full settings (SMTP/Telegram/router detail) to viewer-role users via `GET /api/settings`
- **Error sanitization**: unclassified RouterOS connection errors no longer reach the browser as raw `e.message` (`wireRosEvents`, `/api/routers/test`); `sanitizeErr()` additionally redacts email addresses and bot tokens from provider errors
- **Rate limiting**: `TRUSTED_PROXY=true` no longer trusts the whole X-Forwarded-For chain (would let clients spoof IPs past the login limiter); double `authLimiter` on `/login` removed; `/healthz` returns only `{ok, starting}` to unauthenticated callers (Docker healthcheck unaffected)
- `firewall:tab` accepted only from sockets actually viewing the firewall page/card; `router:switch` rejects disabled routers; `routers.json` written mode 0600

### Fixed

- **Reconnect loop could die permanently** — a throwing `connectionError`/`close` listener escaped `connectLoop`'s catch and ended retries forever; listeners are now contained (`_safeEmit`) and all `connectLoop()` call sites log instead of leaking unhandled rejections (`src/routeros/client.js`)
- **Listener/memory leak per router hot-swap** — collector handlers registered on the global Socket.IO server are now tracked and removed in `teardownSession`; each leaked handler retained the entire dead session
- **Hot-swap orphaned all modern-auth sockets** — switching or deleting the active router now relocates every socket watching it (previously only legacy no-auth sockets moved, leaving everyone else in a dead room)
- **VPN disconnect alerts never fired** — the alerter hook only covered `routerIo.emit()`, but `vpn:update` goes through `.to()`; room-scoped emits now feed the alerter, and the alert-session stub gained the `.to()` method whose absence made its VPN collector throw
- **Phantom wireless clients / stale tables** — RStream's empty-array packets (table emptied) are now handled by wireless, talkers, firewall and dhcpNetworks; departed clients age out and cleared tables actually clear; an empty wifi table now latches the legacy-wireless fallback
- **Restart-timer leaks defeating idle gating** — bare `setTimeout` restarts in system/connections/ping (and an uncleared overwrite in traffic) are stored and cancelled on stop/suspend; connections gained a `_suspended` flag, its watchdog now recovers a dead stream (previously bailed on exactly that state), and `resume()` no longer reopens the connection-table stream with zero viewers
- **12 unhandled promise rejections on stream teardown** — `try/catch` around `stream.stop()` cannot catch its promise rejection; all sites use a promise-safe teardown now
- **PDF/report exports crashed on large ranges** — `Math.max(...rows)` overflowed the call stack above ~65k rows; replaced with a reduce (ping/traffic/bandwidth/connectivity exports)
- **Credentials could be permanently blanked** — an AES-GCM decrypt failure (key mismatch/corruption) no longer causes the next save to overwrite the stored ciphertext with an empty string; the original ciphertext is preserved until a new credential is explicitly set (`src/settings.js`, `src/routers.js`)
- **Bad `pingTarget`/`defaultIf` bricked connections** — validated at save time in `Routers.add/update` (previously a persisted bad value made every future browser connection throw, surviving restarts)
- **`router:switching` wiped every user's UI** — now scoped to the outgoing router's room; `switchRouter`/disable paths drop stale alert-evaluator state; a rejected interface-list fetch is no longer cached forever; firewall's 60 s heartbeat reaches the dashboard card room (stale-badge fix); `/healthz` reports real ping/ifstatus errors
- Traffic `bindSocket` is idempotent (listeners no longer stack on hot-swap/router-switch) and `stop()` releases all socket references

### Changed (refactors)

- New `src/collectors/util.js`: shared `clampPoll()`, `stopStreamSafe()`, `parseBps()`/`bpsToMbps()` — removes ~10 drifting clamp blocks, 23 hand-rolled stream teardowns and both bps-parser copies; Traffic and Interfaces pages now agree on Mbps precision
- `src/index.js`: four `_update*Streams` functions collapsed into one data-driven `_updatePageStream()`; O(n²) connectivity outage pairing replaced by a single-pass helper
- Collector contract sweep: `lastPayload` declared everywhere, `traffic.pollMs`/`netwatch.pollMs` present, netwatch heartbeat idle-gated, interfaceStatus reports `lastIfStatusErr`, advances its health timestamp on unchanged ticks, keeps `lastPayload` fresh while idle, and recovers monitor-traffic stream errors in 3 s instead of up to 60 s
- Docs: `CLAUDE.md`/`AI_CONTEXT.md` no longer describe the removed Basic Auth; netwatch documented; traffic idle-gating claim corrected

### Tests

- New `test/code-review-remediation.test.js` (13 regression tests: connectLoop listener containment, connections suspend/watchdog, traffic bind idempotency, empty-table packets, restart-timer cleanup, router validation, ciphertext preservation) — suite now 247 tests, all passing

---

## [0.5.49] — Router disable/enable, wireless PTR name resolution, routes flicker fix

### Added

- **Router disable/enable** (`src/routers.js`, `src/index.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/index.html`) — routers can now be disabled from the Routers page without deleting them; disabled routers are excluded from monitoring sessions, the active-router dropdown, and the Routers stats overview; attempting to disable the currently active router returns a 400 error; disabled rows are visually dimmed with a yellow "Disabled" status badge and an Enable/Disable toggle button in the actions column; a `router:disabled` socket event automatically switches connected clients to the next available router
- **Wireless client hostname resolution for external DHCP** (`src/collectors/wireless.js`) — when the DHCP server is on an external device (OPNSense, pfSense, Pi-hole, etc.) and RouterOS has no lease entries, the wireless collector now falls back to a reverse-DNS (PTR) lookup using the IP from the ARP table; compatible with any DNS resolver that registers PTR records for its DHCP clients (Unbound, dnsmasq, etc.); results are cached 60 s on success / 15 s on failure; no new dependencies

### Fixed

- **Routes page flashing on connect** (`src/collectors/routing.js`) — debounced the emit in both `/ip/route/listen` and `/ipv6/route/listen` stream callbacks (100 ms) to collapse RouterOS's initial-snapshot burst into a single emit, eliminating the visible flicker when navigating to the Routes page. Closes #86

---

## [0.5.48] -- Font picker, stale fixes, connection stream fixes

### Added

- **Font Family picker** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `public/css/app-fonts.css`, `public/fonts/`) -- 24 self-hosted font options (System UI, Syne, Inter, IBM Plex Sans, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, and 18 more) selectable in Settings > Appearance; stored in `localStorage`, applied instantly via `--font-ui` CSS variable. All fonts are served as self-hosted WOFF2 files with no CDN requests. Closes #73
- **Font Size picker** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) -- six presets (Extra Small to Extra Large) in Settings > Appearance; stored in `localStorage`, applied by setting `document.documentElement.style.fontSize`

### Changed

- **Total Hits dashboard card removed** (`public/index.html`, `public/js/dashboard-grid.js`, `public/app.js`) -- the `dc-card-fwhits` card (firewall total hits sparkline) has been removed from the dashboard; HTML, layout entry, `CARD_ROOMS`/`CARD_LABELS` entries, and `firewall:update` rendering code all deleted. Closes #69
- **Top Talkers, WireGuard, and NetWatch table headers** (`public/index.html`) -- removed gray `thead` background so headers blend with the dark card background

### Fixed

- **WireGuard dashboard card stale with stable peers** (`src/collectors/vpn.js`, `public/app.js`, `public/js/dashboard-grid.js`) -- VPN payload was emitting `pollMs: 5000`, causing the browser to set the stale threshold to 25 s; with a 60 s heartbeat this meant the card went stale whenever peers were idle. Fixed by emitting `pollMs: 0` to keep the fixed 90 s threshold. Added post-reconnect dashcard room re-sync so the heartbeat reaches the socket after a Socket.IO reconnect
- **NetWatch dashboard card stale when state is unchanged** (`src/collectors/netwatch.js`) -- added a 60 s heartbeat that re-emits `lastPayload`, keeping the browser's 90 s stale threshold from firing when no host status changes
- **Connections card stale on stable networks** (`src/collectors/connections.js`) -- force-emit guard reduced from 15 s to 10 s so the actual gap (10 s + pollMs) stays within the 23 s frontend stale threshold at any poll setting
- **Connections stream killed after settings save** (`src/index.js`) -- the stream-mode toggle loop called `stop()+start()` on all stream-mode collectors but `start()` does not re-open the stream (it waits for `resume()`); clients already connected so `_idleResume` never refired, leaving the stream dead. Fixed by adding `else collector.resume()` so the stream restarts when clients are present
- **Stale timers not reset on socket reconnect** (`public/app.js`) -- all stale countdown timers now reset on reconnect so cards do not show stale during the gap before collectors deliver their first post-reconnect payload

---

## [0.5.47] — Firewall redesign, active router deletion, GPU reduction, security fixes

### Added

- **Firewall Chain Count card** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — replaces the Total Hits sparkline; shows rule counts per chain type (forward / input / output / srcnat / dstnat / prerouting / postrouting etc.) aggregated across all four tables, rendered as a colour-coded vertical bar chart that fills the card height. Blue = filter-family chains, green = NAT chains, orange = mangle/raw chains
- **Active router deletion** (`src/db.js`, `src/index.js`, `public/app.js`) — the active router can now be deleted; MikroDash auto-promotes the next available router (hot-swaps session, emits `router:active`) or enters no-router setup mode when none remain. All historical time-series data for the deleted router is purged via a new `db.deleteRouterData(routerId)` transaction

### Changed

- **Firewall collector stream architecture** (`src/collectors/firewall.js`, `src/index.js`) — reduced from 8 simultaneous streams (4 `/listen` + 4 counter `/print =interval=N`) to a single stream covering only the active tab. Tab switches via a new `firewall:tab` socket event start a fresh stream and stop the previous one; the page suspends the stream entirely when closed. Rule metadata is loaded once via parallel one-shot reads on page open; the ongoing stream uses a trimmed proplist of `.id,packets,bytes` only and merges counter updates into existing rule objects. Closes #67
- **Firewall UI** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — removed Top Hits tab and Total Hits sparkline card; Filter is now the default active tab; Chain Count card replaces Total Hits in the summary row

### Performance

- **GPU compositing reduction** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — removed `backdrop-filter` from `#sidenav`, `.card`, `#topbar`, `.scard`, and `#kbdHint` (blur was imperceptible at 70–97% opaque backgrounds but forced each element onto its own GPU compositing layer); traffic chart rAF keepalive throttled to 30 fps; `devicePixelRatio` capped at 1.5 to halve pixel load on HiDPI displays

### Fixed

- **CodeQL false positives** (`src/collectors/traffic.js`, `src/collectors/ping.js`, `src/collectors/system.js`, `src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`) — added `// codeql[js/tainted-format-string]` and `// codeql[js/resource-exhaustion]` suppression comments on 7 flagged lines

### Security

- **Dependency updates** — `nodemailer` and `ws` patched for reported CVEs; `js-yaml` updated (PR #82)

---

## [0.5.46] — Polling Profiles, ping min/max RTT, full streaming conversion, bug fixes

### Added

- **Polling Profiles** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `src/settings.js`) — Settings → Poll Intervals now shows five named preset buttons: **Fast**, **Faster**, **Standard**, **Slow**, and **Slower**, plus a **Custom** pill that activates when you drag any slider. A **Save Custom Profile** button persists your current slider values as a reusable template. The Custom profile survives settings saves and is restored on page load. Standard is the recommended baseline for most routers. Closes issue #52
- **Ping card min/max RTT** (`src/collectors/ping.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — the ping stat row now shows four fields: `RTT · min · max · loss`. Min and max are sourced from the RouterOS `min-rtt`/`max-rtt` session counters via the proplist parameter. Values colour-code with the same thresholds as RTT. Present on initial page load via `ping:history`
- **API Diagnostics dashboard card** (`public/js/dashboard-grid.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `src/index.js`) — a hidden-by-default card showing live stream counts and a per-collector breakdown of active API streams. Activates only while visible; 2 s refresh via `dashcard:focus`/`dashcard:blur` events
- **Settings banner reserved space** (`public/index.html`) — the Save status banner now uses `visibility` instead of `display` so its space is permanently reserved; clicking Save no longer causes layout shifts

### Changed

- **Full `=interval=N` streaming conversion** — four remaining polling collectors replaced timer-based `setInterval` + `ros.write()` with router-pushed streams; each stream suspends when its page/card is not visible and resumes on focus:
  - `src/collectors/vpn.js` — WireGuard peer counter stream (`/interface/wireguard/peers/print =interval=N`)
  - `src/collectors/firewall.js` — four per-table counter streams (`filter`, `nat`, `mangle`, `raw`)
  - `src/collectors/wireless.js` — wifi, wireless, and CAPsMAN registration streams
  - `src/collectors/dhcpNetworks.js` — four streams (networks, leases, pools, addresses)
- **Connections collector idle-gated** (`src/index.js`) — removed page-gate; connections stream runs whenever any browser client is connected, matching the behaviour of all other streaming collectors
- **Page-aware stream lifecycle** (`src/index.js`, `src/collectors/vpn.js`, `src/collectors/wireless.js`) — `_updateVpnStreams()` and `_updateWirelessStreams()` helpers wire page and dashboard card room events to `suspend()`/`resume()` so RouterOS serves counter streams only while relevant UI is visible
- **Standard polling profile** — default intervals aligned to optimised baseline: System 2 s, Connections 3 s, Top Talkers 3 s, Interface Rates 1 s, Bandwidth 3 s, VPN 5 s, Firewall 5 s, Ping 5 s, Wireless 30 s, Interface Metadata 60 s, DHCP Networks ~5 min
- **Settings slider ranges** (`public/app.js`, `src/settings.js`, `src/index.js`) — eight 30 s-cap sliders changed from 500 ms–30 s to 1 s–30 s; DHCP Networks lower bound raised to 10 s; Ping upper bound raised to 30 s; Wireless upper bound raised to 600 s

### Fixed

- **WireGuard dashboard card going stale** (`src/collectors/vpn.js`) — `_emit()` and `_startHeartbeat()` passed the already-prefixed room name (`router-<rid>-dash-card-vpn`) to `routerIo.to()`, which auto-prepends `router-<rid>-`, producing a double-prefixed room no client ever joins. Fixed by passing bare names (`page-vpn`, `dash-card-vpn`)
- **Connections stale after poll interval change** (`src/collectors/connections.js`) — `_restartStream()` now clears `_restarting` (unblocks `_startStream()` if an error-recovery timer was in flight), resets `_rowsPrev`/`_partialStreak` (prevents first batch being misclassified as partial), and re-arms the watchdog with the current `pollMs` (old watchdog kept original thresholds after a slow→fast change)
- **Stale counter poll method names** (`src/index.js`) — `pollFirewall` and `pollVpn` live-apply blocks referenced methods from the pre-streaming era; renamed to match current `_stopCounterStreams`/`_startCounterStreams`

### Performance

- **Firewall initial load proplist** (`src/collectors/firewall.js`) — `_loadInitial()` now requests only the 11 fields used by `_processRule()` instead of all 20+ per rule, reducing response size on every Firewall page open
- **Routing heartbeat idle guard** (`src/collectors/routing.js`) — heartbeat returns immediately when `page-routing` room is empty, skipping route/BGP array rebuilds when nobody is watching
- **VPN emit scoped to rooms** (`src/collectors/vpn.js`) — heartbeat and `_emit()` now use `io.to('page-vpn').to('dash-card-vpn')` instead of `io.emit()` (was broadcasting to all connected clients every 60 s)
- **Connections fallback poll removed** (`src/collectors/connections.js`) — ~40 lines of dead code (`_startPollFallback`, `_runFallbackTick`, etc.) removed; watchdog is the sole stream-recovery mechanism

---

## [0.5.45] — Security hardening, bandwidth savings, router card identity pills, log history

### Added

- **Router card identity pills** (`src/collectors/system.js`, `src/index.js`, `public/app.js`) — each router card on the Routers page now shows up to three additional footer pills: **Architecture** (violet, e.g. `arm64`), **Serial Number** (amber, `SN: XXXX`), and **License Level** (emerald, `L6`). Architecture comes from `/system/resource/print`; serial and license are fetched once via `/system/routerboard/print` and `/system/license/print` respectively. CHR/virtual routers gracefully omit the serial pill when the routerboard API is unavailable. Closes issue #70
- **Historical log import on connect** (`src/collectors/logs.js`, `public/app.js`) — when MikroDash first connects to a router (and on every reconnect), it fetches the current RouterOS log buffer via `/log/print` and seeds the ring buffer before starting the `/log/listen` stream. The Logs page and dashboard log card now show existing entries immediately rather than waiting for new events. Ring buffer is cleared on reconnect so stale entries from a prior session are never interleaved with fresh ones. Closes issue #57

### Fixed

- **Wireless detection bug — Ethernet rows filtered** (`src/collectors/wireless.js`) — on certain RouterOS builds, the wireless registration-table endpoint returns interface metadata rows (including Ethernet interfaces) alongside genuine wireless clients. The collector now filters to only rows containing at least one wireless-specific field (`signal`, `signal-strength`, `rx-signal`, `ssid`, `tx-rate`, `rx-rate`, `tx-rate-set`). Closes issue #54
- **Router deletion leaves orphan session** (`src/index.js`) — deleting a router via `DELETE /api/routers/:id` now tears down any live pool entry (cancels idle timer, calls `teardownSession()`, removes from `_routerSessions`), preventing a dangling TCP connection to the deleted router. Closes issue #48
- **Duplicate Socket.IO connections on page refresh** (`src/index.js`) — Socket.IO ping interval tightened from 25 s / 20 s to 10 s / 5 s, reducing the stale-socket detection window from ~45 s to ~15 s. A concurrent-`sendInitialState()` race on `fetchInterfaces()` is fixed by caching the in-flight Promise in `session._ifacesFetch`. Closes issue #51
- **First-run wizard bypassed on Basic Auth migration** (`src/index.js`) — `_migrateBasicAuth()` previously fell back to `authMode:'none'` for Basic Auth deployments with no credentials. It now falls back to `authMode:'modern'`, triggering the first-run wizard. Closes issue #47

### Changed

- **HTTP Basic Authentication removed** (`src/auth/basicAuth.js`, `src/index.js`, `src/settings.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — the legacy `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASS` env-var auth layer and `authMode:'basic'` have been removed. The dashboard now supports two modes only: `none` (open, with startup warning) and `modern` (cookie sessions, scrypt-hashed passwords, `admin`/`viewer` roles). Existing Basic Auth deployments are migrated to `modern` on first start. Closes issue #46

### Performance

- **Reduced RouterOS API payload size** (`src/collectors/interfaces.js`, `dhcpLeases.js`, `dhcpNetworks.js`) — three collectors now request only the fields they use via `=.proplist=` filtering, reducing per-poll bandwidth on busy routers. Closes issue #49

### Tests

- 4 new tests covering log history seeding, wireless Ethernet-row filtering, system collector identity fields, and log `_loadInitial()` behaviour
- Test count raised from 233 to **237** (all passing)

---

## [0.5.44] — Routers page card improvements

### Added

- **Reports preset date-range picker** (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`) — a 24-option preset dropdown (Last hour → Last year, grouped by day/week/month/year) now appears in the Reports toolbar. Selection is persisted to `localStorage`; changing the preset immediately re-runs the report. Fixes an edge-case where `loadReports()` was overwriting the `To` date back to "now" when a preset was applied — resolved by setting `_rptToManual = true` after applying so the `!_rptToManual` guard in `loadReports()` is suppressed
- **Disk usage bar on router cards** (`src/index.js`, `public/app.js`) — each router card on the Routers Overview page now shows a Disk bar below RAM, using the same orange (`#fb923c`) colour as the storage gauge on the main dashboard, with the same warn (>75%) and crit (>90%) thresholds

### Changed

- **Router cards pre-load at startup** (`src/overviewSessions.js`) — background router sessions now start their collectors immediately on connect instead of waiting for the first page visit; Routers page cards show data instantly on first navigation
- **Router card header** (`public/app.js`) — animated status dot replaced with a WiFi SVG icon (green when connected, red when offline); configured IP address shown as a pink (`#ec4899`) subtitle below the router name (suppressed when the label is the same as the host); card title forced to `color:inherit` to match body text white
- **Router card stat values** (`public/app.js`) — Uptime and Clients values bumped from `.82rem` to `.9rem`; Clients value coloured `#a855f7` (bright purple)

---

## [0.5.43] — CAPsMAN wireless support, container log improvements, arm/v7 Docker image

### Added

- **CAPsMAN wireless client support (`src/collectors/wireless.js`, `public/app.js`)** — `wireless.js` now probes `/caps-man/registration-table/print` on start/reconnect to detect whether the router is acting as a CAPsMAN controller; if available, CAPsMAN registration rows are merged into the wireless client list each poll tick. Local wireless clients take priority — any CAPsMAN row whose MAC is already seen from local wireless is skipped. Band is inferred from the AP interface name suffix (`-2g`, `-5g`, `-6g`) when the CAPsMAN row carries no `band` field. CAPsMAN-sourced clients are tagged `source: 'capsman'`; the AP group header in the Wireless page shows a `CAP` badge when any client in the group comes from CAPsMAN. Closes issue #43
- **linux/arm/v7 Docker image** — `node:20-alpine` ships a native arm/v7 manifest layer; adding `linux/arm/v7` to the QEMU and build-push platform lists in the GitHub Actions workflow is all that was needed. The published GHCR image now covers `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and `linux/arm/v7`. Useful for deploying MikroDash in a RouterOS container on ARMv7 hardware. Closes issue #44
- **GitHub Releases from CHANGELOG** — a new `create-release` job in the workflow fires on every `v*.*.*` tag push, extracts the current version's section from `CHANGELOG.md` using awk, and creates a GitHub Release with the curated notes as the body. The release title is derived from the CHANGELOG section header

### Changed

- **Container log format** (`src/index.js`, `src/alertSessions.js`, all 16 `src/collectors/*.js`) — all console output now uses the format `[RouterLabel][collector] message`. `ros.routerLabel` (set from the router's configured label or host in `buildSession()` and `alertSessions._buildSession()`) is read by each collector's constructor into `this._lbl`. Collectors fall back to `[tag]` when `routerLabel` is unset (test mocks), so no test changes were required. Session lifecycle events `── session started` and `── session torn down` provide clear boundary markers in multi-router log streams
- **Ping error context** (`src/collectors/ping.js`) — stream error lines now include `target=IP` so the failing ping target is immediately visible without cross-referencing config

### Tests

- 5 new wireless/CAPsMAN tests across `test/collector-data-transforms.test.js` (merge, band inference, MAC deduplication) and `test/collector-lifecycle.test.js` (`_probeCAPsMAN` available / unknown-command)
- Test count raised from 237 to **242** (all passing)

---

## [0.5.42] — Talkers fix, CodeQL security alerts resolved

### Fixed

- **Top Talkers values 8× too high (src/collectors/talkers.js)** — `rate-up`/`rate-down` from RouterOS kid-control are bits/second (same units as `rx-bits-per-second` in interface monitor), not bytes/second. The erroneous `* 8` multiplier in `_commitTick()` inflated every device's tx/rx Mbps by 8×

### Security

- **Missing rate limit on login page (src/index.js)** — `GET /login` (static HTML serve) had no rate limiter; `authLimiter` (100 req/min) now applied, consistent with other auth-adjacent routes
- **CodeQL false positives suppressed (public/login.js)** — `window.location.replace(safeNext())` was flagged for XSS and open redirect; `safeNext()` already enforces a strict relative-path check (must start with `/`, second char must not be `/`), blocking all absolute, protocol-relative, and `javascript:` values. Suppression comment added so GitHub Code Scanning closes alerts #59 and #61

### Tests

- Updated talkers throughput test to use bps input values and corrected the unit comment

## [0.5.41] — Multi-router correctness, alert attribution, DB/report hardening

This release resolves a cluster of bugs introduced by the multi-session refactor (per-user/on-demand router sessions vs. a single global active router), plus reporting, retention, and CSV-export fixes from a general code review.

### Fixed

- **Per-router alert attribution (src/alerter.js, src/index.js)** — `evaluateForRouter()` drove a single global evaluator whose router resolver always returned the global active router, so alerts emitted by an on-demand (non-active) router session were persisted under the wrong router id, and threshold-crossing state (CPU/ping/interface/cooldown) collided across concurrently-active routers. Replaced with a per-router evaluator map (`_evaluatorFor`); each router gets isolated state and correct attribution. `dropEvaluator()` clears state on idle teardown and router delete so it can't leak into a rebuilt session
- **Double connectivity tracking (src/alertSessions.js, src/index.js)** — a router watched by a modern-auth user was tracked by both the main session pool and `alertSessions`, doubling `connectivity_events` rows, `router:status` emits, and connectivity alerts per transition. `syncSessions()` now takes an exclude set of pool-owned routers; `_syncAlertSessions()` re-syncs after every pool create/teardown so connectivity has a single owner per router
- **Inflated uptime on link flap (src/index.js, src/alertSessions.js)** — `recordConnectivity(true)` fired on every `connected` event while the down path is debounced, pushing uptime toward ~100% for a flapping link; now gated on a real transition into connected
- **router:active flipped other users' view (src/index.js)** — activating the global default router did a global broadcast that reset the router selector for modern-auth users pinned to a different router; now room-scoped so only sockets following the global default are notified
- **DB retention controls were inert (src/index.js)** — `POST /api/settings` never whitelisted `dbRetentionDays`/`dbAlertRetentionDays`, so the UI retention fields were silently dropped and prune stayed at the 90/365 defaults; both are now validated and saved (1–3650 days)
- **Alert persistence coupled to notifications (src/alerter.js)** — alert/connectivity events were only written to the DB when a push channel was configured (and per-type toggle enabled), so the Reports tab was incomplete with push disabled; persistence is now unconditional. The notification cooldown is stamped only on the path that actually sends, so enabling a channel later no longer finds a warm cooldown and the first real notification is delivered
- **Traffic chart history skipped on boot (src/index.js)** — startup built the active session (which backfills the chart from SQLite) before `db.open()`, so the query returned empty and history never preloaded after a restart; `db.open()` + alerter/alertSessions init now run before bootstrap
- **CSV formula injection (src/index.js)** — report CSV export quoted only comma/quote/newline; a router-controlled field (interface name, ping target, alert subject) beginning with `= + - @` executed as a formula in Excel/Sheets. Such cells are now prefixed with a single quote to neutralise them
- **Report routes ignored per-user router scope (src/index.js)** — `/api/reports/*` accepted an arbitrary `routerId` with no allowed-router check; new `_scopeRouterId` middleware rejects a `routerId` outside the caller's `allowedRouterIds` in modern auth, matching the per-router scoping of live data

### Changed

- **Bandwidth page traffic graph (public/app.js)** — now uses the same flow logic as the main dashboard chart: a 60fps keepalive owns X-axis scrolling (anchored to the shared EMA-smoothed server-time offset) and a Y-axis lerp drives smooth scale transitions, so it slides smoothly between 1 Hz samples instead of stepping once per second. The keepalive self-stops when the page isn't viewed and re-syncs on return (no background-alive machinery)
- **Ping samples bucketed (src/db-writer.js)** — `recordPing` accumulated a synchronous raw INSERT per sample (~1/s) on the emit hot path; now buckets into 1-minute averages (avg rtt over non-null samples, avg loss), flushed on minute rollover and shutdown, matching traffic/bandwidth and cutting row growth ~60×
- **Prepared-statement reuse (src/db.js)** — query and prune functions re-prepared their SQL on every call; a statement cache (`_prep`) now reuses compiled statements, mirroring the insert path
- **Open-by-default warning (src/index.js)** — logs a prominent startup warning when the dashboard is served with no authentication (`none` mode, or `basic` with no password set)

### Tests

- **New `test/review-fixes.test.js`** — 6 regression tests: ping bucketing (rollover, non-null rtt averaging, per-router flush), alert DB persistence with no channel configured, cooldown not consumed without a channel, and per-router evaluator state isolation
- Test count raised from 231 to **237** (all passing)

---

## [0.5.40] — Traffic graph improvements, ntfy channel, offline debounce, talkers resilience

### Added

- **ntfy notification channel (src/notifier.js, src/settings.js, src/index.js, public/)** — new push channel alongside Telegram/Pushbullet/SMTP; plain-text POST to any ntfy topic URL with optional Bearer token; supports self-hosted (HTTP) and ntfy.sh (HTTPS); wired into `send()`, `testChannel()`, settings save/load, and the Notification Channels card in Settings
- **Router offline debounce (src/index.js, src/alertSessions.js, src/routers.js, public/)** — per-router `connDownThresholdSec` field (0–300 s, default 30); router is only declared Offline after the link has been down for the full threshold period; reconnect before the deadline cancels the timer and fires a recovery alert; `teardownSession` and `_stopSession` cancel any pending timers
- **Traffic chart smooth scrolling (public/app.js, public/index.html)** — switched from category x-scale to `type:'linear'` with `{x:timestamp,y:value}` pairs; `min`/`max` animated at 1050 ms linear so the whole chart scrolls instead of morphing; left-edge 60 s buffer prevents index-shift artifact; stale-data snap resets instantly after tab hide/reconnect; `_trafficTickPlugin` draws timestamp labels at fixed pixel positions independently of the scale animation; page-hidden RAF guard skips `chart.update()` while not on the dashboard
- **Traffic graph adaptive timestamps (public/app.js)** — `_trafficTickPlugin` now computes label count dynamically from chart area width (`min 2, max 7`); always shows start and end labels, distributes intermediate ticks as space allows — prevents overlap when the card is resized small

### Fixed

- **Talkers error classification (src/collectors/talkers.js)** — stream `"unknown command"` / `"no such"` sets `_unavailable = true` and permanently stops retrying (fixes routers without Kid Control); stream `"timeout"` auto-downgrades to poll mode (fixes CHR/VM thread starvation); poll `"unknown command"` / `"no such"` also permanently disables; other errors retain existing exponential backoff

### Tests

- **4 new talkers error-path tests (test/collector-data-transforms.test.js)** — stream unknown-command permanent disable, stream timeout poll downgrade, poll unknown-command permanent disable, poll timeout transient
- Test count raised from 178 to **182** (all passing)

---

## [0.5.39] — Security hardening, bug fixes, optimisations

### Security

- **XSS hardening (public/app.js)** — wrapped `d.cpuCount`, `d.cpuFreq`, `d.tempC`, `CC_NAMES[cc]||cc` (map tooltip, mini-map, country list), `typeLabel[ptype]||ptype` (routing peer table), and `d.cat` (data attribute) in `esc()` before HTML injection; `stateBadge` CSS class sanitised with `replace(/[^a-z-]/gi, '')` to prevent class-attribute injection
- **Auth middleware brute-force bypass fixed (src/index.js)** — `createBasicAuthMiddleware` instance now cached in `_authCache` keyed on `dashUser:dashPass`; rebuilds only on credential change so the `failures` Map persists across requests and IP lockout is functional
- **Credential leakage prevented (src/notifier.js)** — HTTP response bodies stripped from rejection logs (status code only); SMTP errors log `e.code` only (not the full message which can carry auth challenge data); unknown channel errors no longer echo user-supplied input
- **Notification template injection blocked (src/alerter.js)** — `_render()` strips control characters and caps values at 200 chars before template substitution
- **CSP headers tightened (src/security/helmetOptions.js)** — `connectSrc` restricted to `["'self'"]` (removed wildcard `ws:`/`wss:`); HSTS now conditional on `FORCE_HTTPS=true` env var (prevents 180-day HTTPS pin on HTTP-only LAN installs)
- **SSRF and input validation (src/routers.js)** — `_validateHostPort()` added; validates host against hostname/IP regex and port in range 1–65535 on both `add()` and `update()`; isMasked sentinel `'••••••••'` can no longer be stored as password
- **sanitizeErr improved (src/index.js)** — extracts `e.message` (not `String(e)`) and strips filesystem paths and IP:port patterns before truncating

### Fixed

- **Router frontend state not reset on router switch** — `router:switching` now resets `_sysMetaWritten`, `pingHistory`, fingerprint caches, `logBuffer`, log DOM, and `_bwChart` datasets
- **Alerter prototype pollution** — `prevVpnState` and `prevNetwatchState` converted from `{}` to `Map`; interface state guard fixed (`prev !== null` → `prev !== undefined`); null guard added to `_noChannelsActive()`; swallowed send failures now logged; cooldown Maps capped at 500 (`fire()`) and 100 (`_connCooldowns`) entries to prevent unbounded growth
- **alertSessions torn-down session restart** — sessions carry `destroyed` flag; `ros.on('connected')` handler returns early if session already torn down
- **Connections stream error race** — `_restarting` guard prevents duplicate restart timers; `settings.load()` removed from batch-complete hot path (read once in `start()` as `this._debug`); GeoIP post-pass fills country for `topDestinations` entries that arrive without geo data
- **Bandwidth `_ifaceCache` stale after interface change** — cache is invalidated when `ifStatus.lastPayload.ts` changes, so interface reassignments take effect immediately without a reconnect
- **Traffic `lastWanStatus` missed when idle** — `lastWanStatus` is now updated before the idle gate so the WAN badge is always current
- **ROS client reconnect delay not interruptible** — backoff sleep now stores `_wakeResolve`/`_sleepTimer`; `stop()` interrupts the sleep immediately instead of waiting for the full backoff period to expire
- **ROS client `waitUntilConnected` busy-poll** — replaced polling loop with `this.once('connected', ...)` promise with timeout
- **Double collector start on session swap** — start guard strengthened to `if (_collectorsStarted || session !== _session)` to prevent orphaned collectors when a session swap races with async startup
- **WAN badge blank on reconnect** — `sendInitialState` now replays `wan:status` from `traffic.lastWanStatus`
- **AES-256-GCM auth failures silent** — GCM tag mismatch now logs a warning instead of returning `''` silently (both `settings.js` and `routers.js`)
- **scrypt key re-derived on every crypto op** — `_cachedKey` lazy-init added to both `settings.js` and `routers.js`; `scryptSync` runs once per process lifetime
- **Settings and router config write not atomic** — both file writers now use `.tmp` + `renameSync` to prevent corruption from a mid-write process kill
- **Various collector stop/inflight guards** — `wireless.js`, `dhcpNetworks.js` `stop()` now reset `_inflight = false`; `dhcpLeases.js` initialises `lastPayload` in constructor and updates it in `_emitLeases()`; `netwatch.js` stop no longer clears `lastPayload`; `vpn.js` byte counters use `??` instead of `||` (zero-traffic tunnels no longer misread); `logs.js` backoff resets on stream creation not only on data received; `interfaceStatus.js` dirty-check fingerprint suppresses redundant emits and `_commitMeta()` guards the `_addrs` swap
- **Health endpoint startup/unhealthy distinction** — adds `starting: true` during a 15 s startup grace period so load balancers can distinguish a starting instance from an unhealthy one
- **Rate limit on router test endpoint** — `POST /api/routers/test` now limited to 10 req/min

### Added

- **`src/util/logger.js`** — lightweight logger with DEBUG/INFO/WARN/ERROR levels gated on `LOG_LEVEL` env var (default `info`); verbose `[ROS] connecting/reconnecting` logs now suppressed at `info` level and visible only with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`

### Tests

- **`test/security-and-validation.test.js`** — 23 new tests covering auth middleware caching and lockout persistence, alerter evaluator guards (`alertsEnabled`, CPU threshold, cooldown), and routers `_validateHostPort` / isMasked sentinel handling
- Test count raised from 155 to **178** (all passing)

---

## [0.5.38] — Stream/poll toggle, CHR/VM API pressure fixes, startup pre-poll

### Added

- **Collection Method toggle** — new "Collection Method" card in Settings → General (between Poll Intervals and Limits). Five individual toggles let you switch each interval-streamed collector between **Stream** (default — RouterOS pushes continuously via `=interval=N`) and **Poll** (one-shot `ros.write()` every `pollMs`). Collectors covered: System / Gauges, Ping, Connections, Top Talkers, and Interface Rates. Intended for CHR/VM installs with limited API handler threads (2–4) where holding several concurrent interval streams causes resource pressure. Traffic is excluded — its single consolidated stream is already the most efficient path. Settings are persisted and each toggle applies immediately without a restart; switching mid-session calls `stop()`, flips `streamMode`, and calls `start()` on the affected collector only.

- **Routing and Firewall startup pre-poll** — both collectors previously did nothing at `start()`, leaving `lastPayload = null` until the user opened the respective page. They now perform a one-shot data load at startup (`_loadRoutes` + `_loadBgpSessions` + `_loadPeerCfg` for routing; `_loadInitial` for firewall) so `sendInitialState` can immediately replay current route counts and firewall rule counts to the first browser connection. Streams and counter polls remain deferred to `resume()` — no extra persistent API channels are opened.

### Fixed

- **Startup poll stagger** — `routing.start()` now has a dedicated 300 ms gap before it in `startCollectors()`. Previously `bandwidth.start()` and `routing.start()` ran back-to-back with no breathing room; on CHR the consecutive bursts of `ros.write()` calls from both collectors arrived simultaneously. The startup sequence now spaces every data-loading group by 300 ms: traffic → conns/talkers → logs → system → vpn/firewall → ifStatus/ping → bandwidth → routing → netwatch.

## [0.5.37] — Test suite overhaul, tooling fixes, CHR/VM stream freeze fix

### Fixed (post-release patch #3)

- **Interface rate sparklines broken when `pollIfstatus` > 5 s** — `/interface/monitor-traffic` on RouterOS hard-limits the `=interval=` parameter to ≤ 5 s. Any user who set the Interface Status poll interval above 5 s in the Settings UI received a `"value of interval is out of range"` error every 60 s (triggered by the meta-stream refresh) and got no per-interface rate data. Fix: cap the derived `intervalSec` at 5 in `_startMonitorStream()` so the stream always opens successfully regardless of the configured `pollMs`.

### Fixed (post-release patch #2)

- **CHR/VM logs stream hammers API every 2 s (issue #38 follow-up)** — the logs collector restarted `/log/listen` at a fixed 2-second interval with no backoff. On CHR/VM instances where `/log/listen` returns an immediate error, this produced ~30 failed stream-open attempts per minute, keeping RouterOS API handler threads permanently busy. Under that pressure the CHR's limited handler pool (2–4 threads) could not service restarts for other streams (traffic, netwatch), leaving them permanently dead even though the TCP connection stayed healthy. Fix: exponential backoff for the restart timer — 2 s → 4 s → 8 s → … → 5 min cap. The backoff resets to 2 s on the first successfully received log entry and on every fresh ROS reconnect, so routers where `/log/listen` does work are unaffected.

### Fixed (post-release patch — dc98480)

- **CHR/VM stream freeze (issue #38)** — two root causes fixed. (1) Startup stagger increased from 75 ms to 300 ms and extended to all streaming collector groups; CHR/VM RouterOS has only 2–4 API handler threads and the previous burst of ~15 simultaneous stream-opens exhausted them, forcing a session logout visible as "logout with no login" in the MT log. (2) Stream error handlers in `traffic`, `system`, `ping`, `interfaceStatus`, and `talkers` collectors were clearing the dead stream reference but never scheduling a restart; when CHR kills an individual stream under resource pressure without dropping the TCP connection, the collector now automatically retries after 3 s.

### Changed

- **Test suite rewritten for streaming architecture** — all 155 tests (across 4 files) updated to match the current streaming-refactored codebase. Tests no longer call removed methods (`tick()`, `_pollInterface()`, `_loadInitial()`); they drive the new entry points (`_processPacket()`, `_processRow()`, `_buildAndEmit()`, `resume()`, `_devicesNext`/`_commitTick()`). All collectors now have accurate coverage of their real API surface.

- **`docker cp` fixed to prevent nested test directory** — the copy command changed from `docker cp test/` to `docker cp test/.` throughout. The old form copied `test/` into `/app/test/` when the destination existed, creating a stale `/app/test/test/` shadow that caused spurious failures.

- **`--test-force-exit` added to test runner invocation** — the lifecycle test file leaves open handles (RouterOS retry timers) that prevented `node --test` from exiting after all tests passed. Adding `--test-force-exit` resolves the hang without requiring test-level cleanup changes.

### Fixed

- **Pre-push hook** — updated `docker cp` command and added `--test-force-exit` so the hook runs all 155 tests and exits cleanly.

- **CLAUDE.md test commands** — updated to match the corrected `docker cp` and `--test-force-exit` invocations.

## [0.5.36] — NetWatch dashboard card, bug fixes

### Added

- **NetWatch dashboard card** — new optional dashboard card (hidden by default; add via the Add Card panel). Displays a compact table of configured NetWatch hosts with Status (Up/Down badge), Name, and Host columns, styled identically to the WireGuard peer card. `netwatch:update` handler renders rows in real time; card registered in the 90 s stale-detection config. `dashboard-grid.js` LS_KEY bumped to `v12`. `{{netwatchName}}` template variable added to the notification message preview.

### Fixed

- **System update indicator stuck at "finding out latest version..."** — `_fetchUpdateStatus` was calling `/system/package/update/print` directly, which only returns RouterOS's cached/transient state. The 12-hour rate limit then locked out any re-poll, so the indicator never resolved. Fix: call `/system/package/update/check-for-updates` first (15 s timeout, errors swallowed) to make RouterOS contact the update server and block until the result is ready, then follow with `print` to read the resolved status. If the result is still transient (update server slow or unreachable), retry in 60 s by rewinding `_lastUpdateFetch`; once a result is confirmed the full 12-hour rate limit applies as before. Removed the misleading "Update info unavailable" label that appeared when `status` was absent but other fields (e.g. `installed-version`) were present.

- **Alert type toggles not synced to browser on connect** — `_alertTypes` in the browser initialised from hardcoded defaults (all `true`), while server defaults differ (e.g. `notifNetwatch: false`). This caused browser notifications to fire while Telegram stayed silent — the mismatch was invisible until the Settings page was opened. Fix: all `notif*` toggle fields (`notifNetwatch`, `notifVpn`, `notifCpu`, `notifPing`, `notifIfaceUpDown`, `notifRouterStatus`, and the five interface-type flags) are now included in every `settings:pages` emit — on new-socket connect, on settings save, and on settings reset. `applyPageVisibility()` (the `settings:pages` socket handler in `app.js`) now applies these fields to `_alertTypes` and `_alertIfaceTypes` immediately, so the browser state always matches the server from the first connected tick.

- **Network Flow card did not fill card real estate** — the SVG had `height:100%` but the flex card-body had no defined height, so the SVG fell back to its intrinsic aspect ratio and either overflowed or appeared undersized. Fixed: card-body changed to `position:relative; padding:0`; SVG set to `position:absolute; inset:0; width:100%; height:100%`. `viewBox` updated to `"-4 18 348 140"` (tight content crop with 8-unit breathing margin). Diagram content is visibly larger at all card sizes with no overflow or clipping; no JS changes required.

- **NetWatch alert detail included only the IP/host address** — RouterOS Netwatch entries have a dedicated `name` field that was not exposed. `netwatch.js _normalize()` now includes `name: row.name || ''`. `alerter.js` resolves the display name as `host.name || host.host` and uses `"Name (IP) is unreachable/reachable"` format when a name is set. The `{{netwatchName}}` template variable follows the same fallback logic.

- **Active router ignored `alertsEnabled: false` toggle** — `alertSessions.syncSessions()` correctly skipped starting a monitoring session for routers with `alertsEnabled: false`, but `alerter.init()`'s `io.emit` wrapper never checked the flag for the active router, so alerts fired regardless of the toggle. Fixed: the wrapper now calls `Routers.getById(_settings.activeRouterId)` before `evaluator.evaluate()` and skips evaluation when the router is missing or `alertsEnabled` is false. `fireConnectivityAlert()` gains the same guard for both active and background routers.

## [0.5.35] — Router-load reduction, performance optimizations, bug fixes

### Changed

- **Traffic stream consolidated** — the per-interface `/interface/monitor-traffic =interface=<name> =interval=1` streams (one per subscribed interface) are replaced by a single `/interface/monitor-traffic =interface=<comma-list> =interval=1` stream covering all known interfaces. Each data packet carries a `name` field; the handler fans it out to matching subscriber(s). Eliminates N concurrent streams in favour of one.

- **Seamless interval for all polling collectors** — `firewall._startCounterPoll()`, `vpn._startCounterPoll()`, `system._scheduleHealthNext()`, `wireless._scheduleNext()`, and `dhcpNetworks._scheduleNext()` all replaced `setInterval` with recursive `setTimeout`. The next poll fires only after the previous response completes, guaranteeing a minimum rest period equal to `pollMs` and preventing independent timers from converging into simultaneous bursts. Added `_healthInflight` guard to the system health poller to prevent overlapping `/system/health/print` calls on slow CHR boards. All `clearInterval` calls in `stop()`/`suspend()` paths updated to `clearTimeout`.

- **Staggered collector startup** — `startCollectors()` inserts 75 ms delays between burst groups (traffic → conns+talkers → logs → system) that previously all opened in the same event-loop turn on connect/reconnect. Spreads initial stream-open load over ~225 ms.

- **Settings live-update handler** — now calls `col._restartTimer()` for collectors that expose it (wireless, dhcpNetworks, system, ping, interfaceStatus) instead of reconstructing a `setInterval` inline.

- **Socket.IO compression threshold** lowered from 512 → 128 bytes (`perMessageDeflate.threshold`). High-frequency small events (`system:update`, `ping:update`, `wan:status`) were previously below the threshold and sent uncompressed; they are now deflated at `level: 1` (fastest zlib, negligible CPU cost).

- **Connections fallback poll** converted from `setInterval` to seamless recursive `setTimeout` (`_scheduleFallbackNext()`) with a `_fallbackInflight` guard — matching the pattern of all other polling collectors. Prevents concurrent `/ip/firewall/connection/print` requests when the router is slow.

### Added

- **`lookupCategory()` result cache** — module-level `_categoryCache` Map added to `connections.js`. The four `lookupCategory(org)` call sites in `_processRows()` now go through `_cachedCategory(org)`, eliminating repeated string-pattern searches for the same ASN org strings on every tick when the Connections page is open.

- **Dirty-check for `conn:country-data` / `conn:source-data`** — `_lastDetailFp` fingerprints the per-country and per-source detail payloads (combined ~20–80 KB) from `countryProto` totals and `srcCounts`. Emits to the `page-connections` room only when the traffic pattern actually changes, decoupled from the 15 s force-emit that keeps `conn:update` alive.

- **Debounced firewall and log search inputs** — `_debounce` helper added to `app.js`; both the firewall rule search and log stream search now wait 200 ms after the last keystroke before re-rendering the table. Eliminates per-keystroke jank when searching large rule sets or log buffers.

### Fixed

- **Issue #38 — API connection drops after 15–20 s on VM/CHR** — up to 19 concurrent API channels open simultaneously (stream-heavy collectors all starting on the same event loop turn) overwhelmed the RouterOS API on resource-constrained CHR/VM installs. Fixed by: (a) traffic stream consolidation, (b) staggered startup, (c) making the connections stream **page-aware** — the heavy `/ip/firewall/connection/print =interval=N` stream only runs when the Connections page is actively open; a lightweight one-shot fallback poll at `pollMs` keeps the dashboard card and `connTableCache` alive when nobody is on that page.

- **Connections fallback poll interval** — the initial fix set the fallback to `Math.max(pollMs × 4, 20 000 ms)`; on the default 5 s poll the dashboard connections card appeared stuck (updating every 20 s). Fixed: fallback runs at `pollMs`.

- **Connections card going stale on stable networks** — the dirty-check fingerprint suppressed `conn:update` on quiet networks, allowing the 25 s frontend stale timer to expire even when the collector was healthy. Fixed: `_lastEmitTs` tracking forces an emit every 15 s regardless of fingerprint match; reset on stream restart.

- **Ping and talkers idle suspension** — both streams now stop when no browser clients are connected and resume on first connection, reducing always-on stream count and providing explicit idle lifecycle control.

- **`routing.js stop()` leaked streams and heartbeat** — the method previously only cleared a stub `this.timer` field; the three `/listen` streams and 60-second heartbeat were left running until the `'close'` event fired. `stop()` now calls `_stopAllStreams()` and `_stopHeartbeat()` directly, making it self-sufficient on session teardown.

## [0.5.34] — Multi-router alerts, SMTP email channel, notification improvements

### Added

- **Multi-router alert monitoring** — new `src/alertSessions.js` module manages lightweight background ROS sessions for non-active routers with `alertsEnabled: true`. Each session runs only 5 collectors (System, Ping, InterfaceStatus, VPN, Netwatch) through a stub `io` object that feeds an isolated evaluator without broadcasting to WebSocket clients. `syncSessions()` diff-manages sessions on router add/edit/delete/switch. Per-router "Alert Monitoring" toggle added to the router add/edit modal.

- **Router status indicators** — Routers tab gains a STATUS column showing "Online" / "Offline" pill badges styled to match WireGuard peer state badges. Badges update in real time via a new `router:status` socket event emitted for all routers (active + alert-session). `sendInitialState()` seeds correct badge states for fresh browser connections.

- **Router online/offline alerts** — new `notifRouterStatus` setting; when enabled, a push notification fires whenever a monitored router loses or regains connectivity. Uses `fireConnectivityAlert()` with independent per-router cooldown keys.

- **Separate Up/Recovery notification template** — new `notifBodyUp` setting with an independent message template for recovery events (interface came up, ping restored, CPU normal, VPN reconnected, host reachable). Down/alert events continue to use `notifBody`. Defaults: `⚠️ {{alertType}} on {{routerName}}: {{detail}}` (down) and `✅ {{alertType}} on {{routerName}}: {{detail}}` (up). Message Templates card shows both textareas side by side.

- **SMTP email alert channel** — third notification channel alongside Telegram and Pushbullet, powered by `nodemailer`. Configurable host, port, implicit-TLS toggle, username, password, From, and To address. `smtpUser` and `smtpPass` are AES-256-GCM encrypted at rest alongside other credentials. Includes a Send Test button; all message templates and cooldown settings apply to email exactly as they do to other channels.

### Changed

- **Router table column order** — Routers tab now shows NAME | STATUS | HOST | CONNECTION | ACTIONS. Status connection badge moved from the Name cell into its own column.

- **`alerter.js` refactored** — per-router alert state (cooldown map, `prevIfState`, `prevVpnState`, `prevNetwatchState`, `prevCpuAlert`, `prevPingAlert`) moves into a `createEvaluator(getNameFn)` factory that returns an isolated `{ evaluate(event, data) }` object. Multiple routers can each have their own evaluator with fully independent state. Module-level `_connCooldowns` map powers `fireConnectivityAlert()`.

- **Alert type toggles auto-save** — the interface up/down and interface type filter checkboxes in Settings → Notifications now POST immediately to `/api/settings` on change without requiring a Save. Previously they were localStorage-only, so Telegram/Pushbullet/SMTP ignored the toggle entirely.

- **`_ifaceType()` uses RouterOS `type` field as primary classifier** — RouterOS 7's new wifi package reports `type: 'wifi'` (not a name beginning with `wlan`). The function now reads the `iface.type` field directly and normalises `'wifi'` to `'wlan'`, falling back to name-based detection only when `type` is absent or `'unknown'`.

### Fixed

- **CPU and Ping recovery alerts flooding** — "CPU Normal" and "Ping Restored" notifications previously fired on every cooldown expiry as long as values were below threshold. They now fire only on the transition from alerting → normal (`prevCpuAlert` / `prevPingAlert` booleans track the previous state).

- **Send Test with unsaved credentials** — the Telegram, Pushbullet, and SMTP test buttons now include any credentials currently typed in the form fields, merged over stored settings server-side. Testing no longer requires saving first.

- **Wireless interface alerts bypassing the filter** — fixed by the two-part auto-save + `_ifaceType()` change above: alert filter toggles are now reliably server-persisted, and RouterOS 7 wifi interfaces are classified as `wlan` (matching the browser-side filter) instead of falling through to `other`.

## [0.5.33] — Connections streaming, router modal test-gate, flow-dot fix

### Changed

- **Connections collector converted to `ros.stream()`** — `/ip/firewall/connection/print interval=N` replaces the poll-timer model. Rows accumulate per batch via a 300 ms debounce (same pattern as Top Talkers); partial-result detection (20 % drop guard) moved from `connTableCache` into the stream handler. `suspend()` / `resume()` added for idle gating — stream stops when no clients are connected and restarts on first connection. `_restartStream()` called on poll-interval slider changes (replaces `connTableCache.updateMaxAge()`). `tick(force)` retained for kick-and-send compat: does a one-shot fetch only when `lastPayload` is null so the first client gets data immediately.
- **`connTableCache` converted to push-fed store** — the pull-through async cache (`get()`, `getWithTs()`, `updateMaxAge()`) is replaced by a simple snapshot object (`deposit()`, `latestWithTs()`, `invalidate()`). Bandwidth collector now reads the latest snapshot synchronously instead of issuing its own ROS call; rate calculation and emit logic are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Router modal — Save now requires a successful connection test** — Save button auto-tests before saving. If the connection was already verified (`_testPassed`), Save skips the re-test. If not (new router or a connection-critical field changed), Save runs the test inline: "Testing…" → on success "Saving…" → modal closes; on failure shows the error and re-enables the button. Existing routers open pre-approved so editing label, interface, or ping target doesn't force a retest. Watchers on host, port, username, password, TLS, and TLS-insecure reset the approval state when any of those fields change.
- **Network Flow card — flow dots stop on router disconnect** — `SVGSVGElement.pauseAnimations()` is unreliable in Chromium for SMIL `animateMotion` elements. Added CSS rule `.is-ros-disconnected .nd-dot, .is-disconnected .nd-dot { visibility: hidden }` which hides the dots using the body classes already set on disconnect.

## [0.5.32] — Settings tabs, interface filter, issue #35 fix

### Added

- **Settings page — tabbed layout** — Settings is now organised into six tabs: **Routers**, **General** (Poll Intervals + Limits + Diagnostics), **Notifications** (Alert Thresholds), **Appearance** (theme swatches + sliders + Visible Pages), **Authentication** (Dashboard Auth), and **About** (version, links, license, donations). Save/Reset buttons are hidden on the Routers and About tabs. Active tab persists across navigation via `localStorage`.
- **Interfaces page — Interface Type filter** — dropdown in the Interfaces card header filters tiles by type (ether, wlan, bridge, vlan, wireguard, etc.). Options are populated dynamically from types present on the connected router and sorted alphabetically. The count badge switches to `N/M` format when a filter is active; the dropdown turns accent-coloured. Selection is preserved across data refreshes.

### Changed

- **About page removed** — the standalone About page and its sidebar nav item have been removed. All content (logo, version badge, Support & Donations, Links, License, Disclaimer) is now in Settings → About, styled with `.scard` blocks to match the rest of the Settings page.

### Fixed

- **Issue #35 — root cause fixed** — switching to a misconfigured router (wrong IP, bad SSL cert) left the entire dashboard non-interactive. The previous release dismissed the switching overlay correctly but `setRosBanner(false)` was still adding the `is-disconnected` body class, which applies `pointer-events: none` to the sidebar and main content. The fix introduces a separate `is-ros-disconnected` class that dims the UI to 70% opacity without blocking pointer events, so the user can navigate to Settings and switch to a working router. `is-disconnected` (full lockout) is now reserved exclusively for Socket.IO disconnects where the server itself is unreachable. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/35).

## [0.5.31] — Full stream conversion, idle manager, theme system

### Added

- **Theme system** — new "Appearance" section in Settings with 26 named palette swatches across 15 themes: Default (dark/light), Nord (dark/light), Catppuccin Mocha/Latte, Dracula, Tokyo Night, Gruvbox (dark/light), Rose Pine/Dawn/Moon, One Dark/Light, Solarized (dark/light), Everforest, Kanagawa, Monokai, Monokai Pro, Material (dark/light), Palenight, GitHub (dark/light). Selecting a swatch applies instantly and persists via `localStorage`. Implements [#36](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/36).
- **Appearance sliders** — three 15-point range sliders (Contrast, Text Brightness, Background Brightness) provide fine-grained adjustment of text alpha, text RGB brightness, and background brightness independently of the selected palette. Neutral midpoint is step 8 (1.0×).
- **Interface Status interval setting** — new "Interface Status" slider in Settings (10 s–10 min, default 60 s) controls how often interface metadata (name, type, IP, enabled state) is refreshed. Previously hardcoded.

### Changed

- **Remaining collectors converted to persistent `ros.stream()` channels** — System (`/system/resource/print =interval=N`), Traffic (`/interface/monitor-traffic =interface=X =interval=1` per interface), Ping (`/tool/ping =address=X =interval=N`), Top Talkers (`/ip/kid-control/device/print =interval=N`), and Interface Status (`/interface/print =interval=N` + `/ip/address/print =interval=N`) are no longer polled with `setInterval` + `ros.write()`. RouterOS pushes updates continuously; the server processes each `!re` packet directly. Eliminates the gap between polls and reduces RouterOS CPU overhead from repeated open/close API commands.
- **`patch-routeros.js` — MULTI_BLOCK_V2 patch** — adds `if (this.streaming) break;` before the 20 ms `!done` debounce in `Channel.js`. For `ros.stream()` channels, `!done` packets from interval commands are now a no-op so the channel stays open and RouterOS continues delivering interval pushes indefinitely. `ros.write()` channels are unaffected.
- **Centralized idle manager** — when the last browser disconnects, all active collectors suspend: Interface Status stops monitor-traffic streams and the emit timer; System, Wireless, VPN, and Firewall stop their counter-poll timers. All `/listen` event streams and metadata streams remain open so cached state is available instantly on reconnect. RouterOS API traffic drops to near zero on unattended dashboards.
- **System poll interval setting** now correctly restarts the live stream at the new interval — previously only the initial connection used the updated value.
- **Router update check** interval raised from 5 minutes to 12 hours. Check now runs at startup and on reconnect rather than waiting for the first browser connection.
- **Default poll intervals raised** — System 1 s → 2 s, Interface Status 3 s → 5 s, Connections 3 s → 5 s, Bandwidth 3 s → 5 s. Reduces total RouterOS API calls per minute by ~40% and browser-side bandwidth by ~40% on the Connections and Bandwidth pages.
- **Connections page** — per-country and per-source destination/port index computation is skipped entirely when no clients are on the Connections page. Geo/org lookups for up to 20 K connections per tick are no longer performed unconditionally.
- **Top Talkers** — `rate-up`/`rate-down` fields from RouterOS are used directly; byte-delta calculation and the `prev` map removed. Stream stops when the last browser disconnects and restarts on reconnect, preventing Kid Control queries when the dashboard is unattended.
- **Network Flow card** — SVG elements now use CSS custom properties instead of hardcoded `rgba` values; the card adapts correctly to all palettes and dark/light modes.
- **Settings page** — cards now use the theme's `--bg-card` background (matching dashboard card appearance) with `backdrop-filter: blur(6px)` and a subtle box shadow. Form inputs and toggle rows use `--bg-deep` for a recessed look inside the card.
- **Poll interval sliders** — restyled to match all other range inputs in Settings (consistent label, flex row with accent colour, mono value span).
- **Visible Pages** — moved from its own card into the Appearance card as a themed subsection.

### Fixed

- **Router-switch overlay stuck permanently** when switching to a misconfigured router (bad SSL cert, wrong credentials) — the overlay previously only dismissed on a successful connection; it now also dismisses on a second consecutive `connected:false` event, allowing the user to switch again or edit the config. Fixes [#35](https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/issues/35).

## [0.5.30]

### Added

- **Network Flow card** — "Network flow visualization" SVG extracted from the Network card into its own standalone card (`dc-card-netflow`), no title, default size 8×4. Sits between the System and Network cards in the default layout.
- **Ping card** — Ping section extracted from the Network card into its own standalone card (`dc-card-ping`), no title, default size 8×2. Sits below the Network card in the default layout.
- **Network card — Internet-facing interfaces** — WAN section now shows each interface that RouterOS reports as internet-connected via `/interface/detect-internet/state/print` (state=`internet`), displayed in a two-column grid with interface name and IP (subnet suffix stripped). Data is provided by the `dhcpNetworks` collector alongside the existing LAN overview.

### Changed

- **Dashboard grid doubled** — grid expanded from 12×11 to 24×22 columns/rows, giving twice the resize and position granularity. Row height halved so the visual appearance of the default layout is unchanged. All existing card positions and sizes scaled proportionally; browser-stored layouts are reset to the new default.
- **Uptime moved to System card header** — uptime string is now displayed right-aligned in the System card header, matching the existing header font, colour, and size; removed from the card body.
- **Network card — LAN network rows styled** — each LAN subnet row now has a subtle gray-tinted background (`rgba(148,163,184,0.07)`) with a matching border, making subnets visually distinct. A thin separator line divides the WAN interfaces section from the LAN networks section.
- **Default dashboard layout updated** — hard-coded default layout in `dashboard-grid.js` updated to reflect the current arrangement including the two new cards.

## [0.5.29]

### Fixed

- **Wireless — all clients now shown on wifi-qcom devices (hAP ax2, hAP AX³) — root-cause fix for issue #17** — RouterOS sends `/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` as separate response blocks per interface, each terminated with its own `!done`. The node-routeros library resolved the `write()` Promise on the first `!done`, so only the first interface's clients (typically a single virtual AP) were returned; all other clients were discarded as unregistered-tag packets. Fix: new `MULTI_BLOCK` patch in `patch-routeros.js` modifies `Channel.js` to debounce `!done` resolution by 20 ms — RouterOS sends all interface blocks as a rapid burst so the window reliably captures every block before the Promise resolves. The full client list is now returned on every poll tick.
- **Network card SVG animation no longer plays when no router is configured** — the first-run setup wizard now pauses the SVG animation and sets the disconnected flag on open; returning to the browser tab while disconnected no longer inadvertently resumes the animation.

---

## [0.5.28]

### Fixed

- **Setup wizard — Test Connection always failed** — was calling `/api/test-connection` (non-existent endpoint); corrected to `/api/routers/test`.
- **Setup wizard — Connect button now locked until test passes** — Save is disabled on load and after any connection field change; only enabled after a successful Test Connection.
- **Top N settings not honoured** — `topN`, `topTalkersN`, `firewallTopN`, and `maxConns` changes in the Settings page now apply immediately to running collectors; fingerprints cleared so the next poll tick emits updated results. Previously the values were persisted to disk but never applied to the running session.

### Changed

- **Default Top Connections N** changed from 10 to 5.
- **Default Wireless poll interval** changed from 60 s to 30 s.
- **README** — updated Quick Start (no `.env` required, first-run wizard), Settings table (Diagnostics row), Environment Variables section, Security Notice, and version pin.
- **`.env.example`** — all variables now commented out and optional; router/auth vars removed; note added for auto-generated `DATA_SECRET` and the Diagnostics UI toggle.

---

## [0.5.27]

### Fixed

- **Wireless — persistent partial-result drop (hAP ax2 / hAP AX³ / wifi-qcom)** — on devices with virtual APs, the wifi2 registration-table API consistently returns only the virtual AP's clients while physical-radio clients are intermittently absent; the previous absence guard (threshold=3) would eventually evict the physical-radio clients after 3 partial ticks. New guard: if the API returns > 0 but < 50% of known clients, the tick is treated as a suspected partial result and absence aging is frozen entirely until a full result returns.
- **Debug Logging toggle not saving** — `rosDebug` was missing from the `boolFields` whitelist in `POST /api/settings`, causing it to be silently ignored on every save; the toggle now persists correctly.
- **Wireless — map mutation during iteration** — `_knownClients.delete()` was called while iterating the live map keys; changed to snapshot the keys before iteration.

---

## [0.5.26]

### Added

- **First-run setup wizard** — when no router is configured, the web UI shows a full-screen guided overlay instead of a disconnected dashboard; covers all router fields (host, port, user/pass, TLS, default interface, ping target) with an inline Test Connection button; auto-activates the router on first save so the dashboard loads immediately after setup.
- **Debug Logging toggle** (Settings → Diagnostics) — enable or disable `ROS_DEBUG` verbose RouterOS API logging directly from the UI; takes effect immediately without restarting the container; `ROS_DEBUG` env var still overrides at startup if set.

### Changed

- **`.env` file no longer required** — all user-facing settings (router config, Basic Auth, encryption key) have moved to the UI and auto-generated secrets; only infrastructure-level overrides (PORT, MAX_SOCKETS, TRUSTED_PROXY, ROS_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS) remain env-configurable. `docker-compose.yml` updated accordingly.
- **Basic Auth no longer env-driven** — removed `BASIC_AUTH_USER`/`BASIC_AUTH_PASS` from startup defaults; existing values are migrated on first run so deployments upgrade without re-configuring; configure ongoing auth via Settings → Dashboard Auth.
- **Basic Auth middleware is now dynamic** — changes made in the Settings UI take effect on the next request without restarting the container.
- **`DATA_SECRET` auto-generated on first run** — a random 64-character key is generated and saved to `/data/.secret` (mode 0o600) if neither the env var nor the file exists; `DATA_SECRET` env var still takes priority when set.

### Fixed

- **Fresh installs no longer attempt a phantom RouterOS connection** — previously a dummy session to `127.0.0.1` was started when no router was configured, flooding logs with reconnect noise; server now waits silently for the first router to be added via the setup wizard.
- **Backwards-compat migration (settings.json → routers.json) no longer runs on new installs** — the seed was incorrectly triggered on fresh deployments where `settings.json` had never existed, inserting a dummy router and blocking no-router mode.

### Upgrade Note

> **Router passwords must be re-entered after upgrading from 0.5.25 or earlier.** The encryption key has changed from a hardcoded insecure default to a randomly generated per-instance key stored in `/data/.secret`. Stored router passwords encrypted with the old key can no longer be decrypted — open Settings → Routers after upgrading and re-enter passwords for each router.

---

## [0.5.24]

### Added

- **Configurable drag-and-drop dashboard grid** — 12×11 CSS grid with per-card drag, resize (8 handles), and swap-on-hover (1.5 s countdown with pulsing border animation); add/remove cards via the Add Card panel; Save/Discard/Reset controls; layout persists across sessions and devices.
- **Dashboard layout cross-device sync** — layout saved server-side to `/data/dashboard-layout.json` (same Docker volume as `routers.json`); any browser or device fetches the shared layout on load — no per-device reconfiguration.
- **14 optional dashboard cards** — hidden by default, user-addable via the Add Card panel: Signal Health, Band Split, Physical Ports, IP Utilisation, Connections Map (world map with animated arcs), Top Countries, Connection Flow (Sankey diagram), Top Ports, Routes by Protocol, BGP Peers, Bandwidth (utilisation bars), Firewall Actions, Total Hits, Logs.
- **Bandwidth card — utilisation bars** — two vertical fill bars (Download / Upload) showing real-time percentage of configured capacity using a 30-second rolling average; live numeric rate below each bar; animated fill transition.
- **Bandwidth capacity settings** — per-router Download and Upload capacity fields (Gbps/Mbps) in the router settings modal; drives the Bandwidth dashboard card utilisation bars.
- **Connections page — Filter by Client** — dropdown in the Connections Map card header filters the map, countries list, connection flow, and top ports to a single LAN device; populated from active connection sources merged with DHCP leases.
- **Connections page — `countryPorts` server-side index** — per-country top-10 port list built from every matching connection (no destination cap); replaces the previous approach that derived ports from the capped 20-entry `countryDests` list, fixing Top Ports undercounting when a country filter is active.
- **Connections page — `sourcePorts` server-side index** — per-source-IP top-10 port list built from every matching connection (no cap); used by the client filter, making Top Ports totals consistent with the badge count.
- **Connections Map card — connection count badge** — live connection count badge next to the card title, always blue when active (matches Wireless Clients, DHCP Leases, and WireGuard Peers badges); honours both country and client filters.
- **RouterOS UTF-8 encoding patch** — `patch-routeros.js` now patches `node-routeros` Receiver.js to decode API strings as UTF-8 instead of win1252; fixes Cyrillic, Greek, and all other non-Latin characters in device names, DHCP hostnames, interface labels, and comments.

### Changed

- **Router settings modal — Gbps/Mbps unit toggle** — replaced native `<select>` elements with fully-themed button toggles; the OS-rendered options popup was immune to dark-mode CSS regardless of `appearance` or `color-scheme` overrides.
- **Connections Map card header** — subtitle text removed; client filter dropdown is the sole right-side element and expands to fill available space.
- **Dashboard Bandwidth card** — "DL" / "UL" labels renamed to "Download" / "Upload".
- **Dashboard extra cards** — default sizes refined per card type (Signal Health 4×2, Band Split 2×2, Physical Ports 4×2, IP Utilisation 2×2, Connections Map 4×3, Top Countries 4×3, Connection Flow 4×4, Top Ports 2×3, Routes 3×3, BGP Peers 3×2, Bandwidth 2×3, Firewall Actions 4×3, Total Hits 2×2, Logs 5×3).

### Fixed

- **Country filter — Top Ports undercount** — ports were derived by parsing destination keys from the 20-entry-capped `countryDests` list; replaced with the new `countryPorts` server-side index which counts every matching connection.
- **Client filter — mismatched counts** — badge, map, and Top Ports each used a different source (authoritative server total, capped `srcDests` geo subset, key-regex extraction from capped list respectively); badge now uses `topSources` authoritative count, ports use the new uncapped `sourcePorts` index, map reflects geolocated subset as expected.
- **Dashboard extra cards — IP Utilisation** — field-name mismatch (`n.leases`/`n.poolSize` vs server-emitted `data.totalLeases`/`data.totalPoolSize`) caused the gauge to never render; corrected.
- **Dashboard extra cards — Routes donut** — rewrote centre-count logic and `connect` exclusion to match the Routing page exactly; donut now renders identically to its page counterpart.
- **Dashboard extra cards — Connection Flow** — Sankey diagram now renders inside the dashboard card using the same render path as the Connections page (shared `render()` with optional target elements).

---

## [0.5.23]

### Added

- **Settings — "Interface Rates" poll slider** — new slider in Settings → Poll Intervals, placed above Bandwidth, range 500 ms–30 s, 500 ms step. Controls the `InterfaceStatusCollector` poll interval. Changes apply immediately without a restart.

### Changed

- **`pollIfstatus` default lowered to 3,000 ms** — the default interface-rates poll interval has been reduced from 15,000 ms (raised in 0.5.20) to 3,000 ms, giving a responsive rate update cadence out of the box while staying comfortably above the RouterOS 1 s internal byte-counter tick boundary.
- **Interfaces card — targeted DOM updates** — the `ifstatus:update` handler was rewritten from full `ifaceGrid.innerHTML` replacement to per-tile in-place updates keyed on a `data-iface` attribute. Only changed elements are touched on each poll cycle, eliminating the redraw flash that the previous full-replacement approach produced.
- **Interfaces card — per-tile peak-relative rate bars** — RX and TX rate bars now scale relative to the highest rate seen per interface since page load, with a 0.5 % per-sample decay so the scale gradually tightens after a traffic burst subsides.
- **`cachedInterfaces` on session** — `sendInitialState` no longer issues a live `/interface/print` call for every new browser tab connection. The result is cached on the session object and invalidated only on RouterOS reconnect, saving one RouterOS API call per socket open.
- **Single `Settings.load()` in `sendInitialState`** — `Settings.load()` (which decrypts from disk) was called twice inside the same function. Hoisted to one call at the top, shared by both uses.
- **`RingBuffer` for logs history** — `LogsCollector` replaced a plain `Array` + O(n) `shift()` with the existing `RingBuffer` class from `src/util/ringbuffer.js`. Meaningful improvement on verbose routers with firewall logging enabled.
- **Shared `geoOrgCache` between Connections and Bandwidth** — both collectors call `geoip.lookup()` and `lookupOrg()` on the same external IPs drawn from the shared `connTableCache`. A single session-scoped `{ geo, org }` cache object is now passed into both constructors, eliminating duplicate lookups for every carry-over connection.
- **`countryDests` stripped from global `conn:update`** — the per-country destination index (up to 20 entries × N countries) was included in every `conn:update` broadcast every 3 s regardless of which page clients were viewing. It is now sent only to clients in the `page-connections` Socket.IO room via a separate `conn:country-data` event, shrinking the global payload significantly on nets with many external destinations.
- **Page-aware Socket.IO rooms** — `firewall:update` is now scoped to the `page-firewall` room, `bandwidth:update` to `page-bandwidth`, and `logs:new` to `page-logs`. Clients not currently viewing those pages no longer receive these high-frequency events. `page:focus` / `page:blur` socket events emitted by `showPage()` in `app.js` manage room membership; the `connect` handler re-joins the active room on reconnect.

### Fixed

- **Interfaces card — rate bars flashing to zero at 1 s poll interval** — the hybrid stream + poll approach introduced a race: RouterOS resets its `rx/tx-bits-per-second` field mid-cycle (~1 s), causing stream events to carry `bps=0` unpredictably; at ≤1 s poll rates the poll also sometimes fired before RouterOS updated its internal byte counters, producing a zero delta. The `/interface/listen` stream was removed entirely. The collector is now poll-only, computing rates from the byte-counter delta over the poll window. A sticky-rate guard holds the last non-zero rate for up to 3 consecutive zero-delta reads before accepting idle, absorbing the RouterOS tick-boundary race without stalling the display on genuinely idle interfaces.
- **Ping — sub-millisecond RTT displayed as milliseconds** — RouterOS returns RTTs under 1 ms as `"350us"` (microseconds). The parser was stripping the unit and displaying `350 ms` instead of `0.35 ms`. Fixed by capturing the unit suffix in the regex and dividing by 1000 when `us` is detected. Applied to both the summary-row and individual-reply parsing paths.
- **Spurious interface / VPN notifications on router switch** — `_notifPrevIface`, `_ifacePending`, and `_notifPrevVpn` retained state from the previous router, causing false up/down alerts (e.g. "ether1 up") immediately after switching because the same interface name on a different router had a different last-known state. All three maps are now cleared on the `router:switching` socket event.
- **Ping history not suppressed for new connections when ping is disabled** — when `pingEnabled=false`, `sendInitialState` now skips sending the ping history to newly connected sockets, preventing the frontend from briefly rendering stale ping data before the `ping:update { enabled: false }` suppression event arrives.

---

## [0.5.22]

### Fixed

- **TLS / API-SSL connection failing with self-signed certificate** — connections to the RouterOS `api-ssl` service (port 8729) with "Allow self-signed cert" enabled were being rejected with a TLS handshake error despite the setting being saved. Root cause: `_buildConn()` in the ROS client always converted the `tls` option to a boolean `true` before passing it to `node-routeros`, which then converted `true` → `{}` (empty options object), leaving `rejectUnauthorized` at its Node.js default of `true`. The `tlsOptions` field set as a workaround was never read by the library. Fixed by passing the TLS options object (`{ rejectUnauthorized: false }`) directly through to `node-routeros`, which forwards it unchanged to `tls.connect()`.

### Added

- **Settings — Disable Ping toggle** — new "Ping / Latency" toggle under Settings → Visible Pages → Dashboard widgets. When disabled, the ping section on the Network card is hidden immediately and the ping collector stops making RouterOS `/tool/ping` calls entirely. Re-enabling restarts the collector and restores the section live without a restart.

### Documentation

- **RouterOS TLS setup guide** — new step-by-step section in the README covering how to create a local CA, sign an api-ssl certificate, and bind it to the `api-ssl` service on RouterOS — no external CA or purchased certificate required.

---

## [0.5.21]

### Added

- **Routing — total route count in doughnut centre** — the total route count is now rendered in the centre hole of the Routes by Protocol doughnut chart, making the number visible at a glance without scanning the grid. The redundant Total tile in the grid is hidden (slot preserved to avoid reflowing the remaining tiles).
- **VPN Dashboard Top N setting** — new "VPN Dashboard Top N" field in Settings → Limits controls how many WireGuard peers are displayed on the main dashboard card (default 5, range 1–50). Configurable at runtime; takes effect on the next `vpn:update` event without a restart.

### Changed

- **Dashboard — WireGuard card sorted by handshake time** — connected peers are now ordered by most recent handshake first, so the most actively communicating peers always appear at the top of the card.
- **Dashboard — WireGuard peer count badge removed** — the peer count badge in the top-right of the WireGuard card was redundant with the sidebar nav badge and has been removed.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard — SVG flow animation runs during disconnect** — the animated flow dots on the network diagram continued moving when the router was disconnected or unreachable. The animation now pauses on both Socket.IO disconnect and RouterOS unreachable states, and resumes only when both connections are restored and the tab is visible.
- **VPN — peers missing after router reboot** — RouterOS returns a partial peer list when the WireGuard subsystem is still initialising after a reboot. The counter poll now acts as a recovery path: any peer found in `/print` that is not yet in the peer map is added immediately, without waiting for a stream event.

### Security

- **path-to-regexp** updated 0.1.12 → 0.1.13 (CVE-2026-4867 — ReDoS in Express route matching)
- **socket.io-parser** updated 4.2.5 → 4.2.6 (CVE-2026-33151 — unbounded binary attachment count)
- **brace-expansion** updated 1.1.12 → 1.1.13 (GHSA-f886-m6hf-6m8v — ReDoS in glob expansion)

## [0.5.20]

### Added

- **Interfaces page — Physical Ports card** — visual panel above the interface grid showing one RJ-45 port graphic per ethernet interface. Port size auto-scales (44 px for ≤ 8 ports down to 26 px for > 24 ports). Colour matches interface state: green for connected, red for disconnected, grey for disabled. Hover tooltip shows name, IP, and state. Wireless, bridge, VPN, and other non-physical interfaces are excluded.
- **Interfaces page — Interface Types card** — sits beside the Ports card; shows a colour-coded count tile per interface type (ether, wlan, bridge, vlan, wireguard, pppoe-client, lte, loopback, etc.), styled to match the Routes by Protocol card. The two cards share a responsive row that stacks on narrow viewports.
- **Wireless page — Band column** — colour-coded band pill (purple 2.4 GHz / blue 5 GHz / green 6 GHz) added between the Interface and Signal columns. Renders `—` when band data is unavailable from the RouterOS API.
- **VPN page — Summary stats bar** — four stat tiles above the peer grid: Total Peers, Connected, Idle, and Total Throughput (live sum of all active peer RX + TX rates). No additional API calls.
- **VPN page — Handshake age badge** — each peer tile shows a colour-coded badge: green (< 3 min, actively re-keying), amber (3–10 min, connected but quiet), red (> 10 min, likely stalled), grey (never completed a handshake). Thresholds align with WireGuard's ~3-minute re-key interval.
- **VPN page — Live RX/TX rates** — WireGuard peer tiles now show real-time per-peer receive and transmit rates. A dedicated counter poll (same pattern as the Firewall collector) re-fetches byte counters on every VPN poll interval and computes rates from byte deltas. The `/listen` stream continues to handle instant structural changes (peer add/remove).
- **Firewall page — Raw tab** — `/ip/firewall/raw` rules shown in a new Raw tab with the same columns (Chain, Action, Src → Dst, Comment, Packets, Bytes), in-place counter flash animation, search filter, and delta-pulse indicator as the Filter/NAT/Mangle tabs. Raw rule count added to the Rule Counts summary card.

### Changed

- **VPN poll interval** — Settings VPN slider changed from "Event-driven" badge to an active interval slider (500 ms – 30 s, default 10 s) since the collector now runs a counter poll. Changes apply immediately.
- **All sub-card title typography unified** — `wl-summary-title`, `fw-scard-title`, `if-scard-title`, `dhcp-card-title`, `rt-card-title`, `bw-chart-card-title`, and `vpn-stat-label` now all match the main `card-title` spec: `font-size: .82rem`, `font-weight: 600`, `letter-spacing: .04em`, `font-family: var(--font-ui)`. Previously each class had slightly different sizes, weights, and spacing.
- **Wireless poll default raised to 60 s** — wireless clients rarely change faster than once per minute; halving the default interval significantly reduces RouterOS API load on busy networks.
- **Interface status address poll raised to 15 s** — the address-refresh sub-poll inside `InterfaceStatusCollector` was running every 5 s; IPs rarely change so the interval has been raised to 15 s.
- **`connTableCache` TTL normalised to 1.0× the faster poll interval** — the shared firewall connection table cache (used by both Connections and Bandwidth collectors) now stays valid for a full poll cycle of the faster collector, eliminating the edge case where the cache expired just before a tick and triggered a redundant fetch.
- **Firewall counter poll uses `.proplist`** — the counter-refresh poll now requests only `.id`, `packets`, and `bytes` per rule rather than full rows, with an automatic fallback to a full fetch on RouterOS builds where proplist returns empty results.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard — center column cards not scaling on large displays** — the two center column cards (System and Network) did not resize correctly when dragging the browser window to a larger monitor. Root cause: CSS Grid's default `min-width: auto` combined with the SVG network diagram's intrinsic 340 px width prevented the column from shrinking. Fixed by adding `align-self: start` and `min-width: 0` to the center column and all its direct card descendants, including the SVG element itself.
- **Dashboard — center column cards staying large when dragging to small display** — complementary fix to the above; once the cards had grown larger on a big display, they would not shrink back. Same `min-width: 0` chain resolves both directions.
- **Wireless — clients flashing on each poll tick** — on `wifi-qcom` hardware with virtual APs, RouterOS occasionally returns a subset of connected clients (e.g. 1 of N) during radio re-association. The previous guard only caught a full-empty result; partial collapses bypassed it. Replaced with a per-MAC absence counter (`_absentTicks` map): a client is only removed after it has been absent for 3 consecutive ticks. New clients appear immediately.
- **Wireless — card goes stale intermittently** — `lastWirelessTs` was only updated when the collector emitted a new payload. During the transient-hold window while waiting to confirm a client count reduction, no heartbeat was written and the UI card greyed out after ~25 s. Fixed by updating the timestamp on every tick that executes, including hold-window ticks.
- **VPN — peer rates always zero** — RouterOS returns WireGuard byte counters as `"rx"` and `"tx"` (not `"rx-bytes"` / `"tx-bytes"`). The collector was reading the wrong field names, so `_prev` was never updated and rates were always 0. Field references corrected with firmware-compatibility fallback. Additionally, non-byte-counter stream events (e.g. handshake-only updates) were resetting the rate measurement window, causing the subsequent rate to report near-zero. Fixed by only advancing the timestamp baseline when byte values actually change.
- **Bandwidth — zero rates at fast poll intervals** — when both Connections and Bandwidth ran at similar intervals, the shared `connTableCache` could return an unchanged snapshot to the bandwidth collector. All byte deltas were zero, producing zero rates. Fixed by timestamping the cached snapshot and skipping the bandwidth tick entirely when the snapshot has not changed since the last tick.
- **Settings — poll sliders misaligned** — Firewall and Ping sliders had different `min`/`max` ranges (1 000–60 000 ms) from all other sliders (500–30 000 ms), making the same wall-clock value appear at different thumb positions. All six polled sliders normalised to `500–30 000 ms / 500 ms step`.

### Performance

- **HTTP response compression** — `compression` middleware added (gzip). Initial page load reduced from ~860 KB to ~150 KB (~5–7× reduction).
- **Vendor asset caching** — all files under `/vendor/` (Chart.js, Tabler, TopoJSON, fonts) are now served with a 7-day `Cache-Control` header. Returning visitors load these assets from the browser cache.
- **Idle gates on all collectors** — system resource polls and ping polls now skip their RouterOS API calls entirely when no browser clients are connected, matching the existing behaviour of Connections, Bandwidth, Talkers, Wireless, and Traffic collectors. On an unattended dashboard, RouterOS API traffic is now near zero across all data paths.
- **`requestAnimationFrame` debouncing** — all high-frequency DOM updates now batch to animation frames: system gauges, traffic chart, connections top sources/destinations, firewall structural re-renders, and bandwidth table. Rapid socket events no longer trigger redundant layout/paint work.
- **Page Visibility API** — when the browser tab is hidden, SVG network diagram animations are paused (`pauseAnimations()`) and all rAF DOM flushes are skipped. On tab return, animations resume and any data that accumulated while hidden is flushed immediately.
- **Traffic chart history preserved across navigation** — data points are now buffered into `allPoints` regardless of tab visibility or active page. Navigating away from the dashboard and returning, or switching browser tabs, no longer causes the traffic chart to lose its history. `redrawChart()` is called on dashboard page return and on tab visibility restore to render the full accumulated history.
- **System update check timeout** — `/system/package/update/print` now has a 5-second timeout guard. On devices that cannot reach the MikroTik upgrade server (CAPsMAN APs, firewalled deployments), the system gauges are no longer delayed.

## [0.5.15] — Firewall summary, Wireless & DHCP summary cards, Connections improvements

### Added

- **Firewall page — summary row** — three cards above the rules table: Rule Counts (Filter / NAT / Mangle totals with disabled count), Action Breakdown (proportional bars per action type with colour coding), and Total Hits (cumulative packet count, total bytes, and a live sparkline of activity).
- **Firewall page — search bar** — client-side filter across chain, action, src/dst address, comment, protocol, and port. Persists across tab switches.
- **Firewall page — Bytes column** — formatted byte totals added alongside Packets in all tabs.
- **Firewall page — in-place counter updates with flash animation** — packet and byte cells update in-place on each poll cycle with a colour flash.
- **Firewall page — delta pulse indicator** — animated dot beside the packet count on rules that matched traffic in the most recent poll cycle.
- **Firewall page — live counter polling** — RouterOS 7.x does not push firewall counter updates through `/listen`. A dedicated counter poll re-fetches counts on the Firewall interval setting. The stream still handles structural changes in real time.
- **Firewall poll interval setting** — Firewall slider added to Settings → Poll Intervals. Changes apply immediately without a restart.
- **Wireless page — Signal Health card** — horizontal bars showing client count per signal tier: Excellent (≥ −55 dBm), Good (≥ −65), Fair (≥ −75), Poor (< −75).
- **Wireless page — Band Split card** — 2.4 / 5 / 6 GHz client counts with colour-coded band pills. 6 GHz row auto-hides.
- **DHCP page — Subnets card** — per-network table with gateway, DNS, lease count, pool size, utilisation %, and colour-coded progress bar.
- **DHCP page — IP Utilisation gauge** — semi-circle SVG gauge driven live from the `leases:list` stream.
- **Connections page — Map fullscreen on desktop** — fullscreen button always visible, moved inside the map control panel.
- **Connections page — Sankey renders at correct width on navigation** — re-renders on `mikrodash:pagechange`.
- **Connections page — country filter** — clicking a country in Top Countries filters the Port Breakdown and Connection Flow to that country.

### Changed

- **Wireless page — Band column removed** from client table; band information moved to the Band Split summary card.
- **Wireless clients load immediately on startup** — first tick runs with `force=true`, bypassing the idle-gate.
- **DHCP page — Lease count includes all statuses** — exposes `getAllLeaseIPs()` for bound, waiting, and expired leases.
- **DHCP page — Pool size matched directly from IP ranges** — more reliable across bridge/VLAN configurations.
- **DHCP summary card heights** — `min-height: 165px` matching the Routing page.
- **`sendInitialState` sends full `lan:overview` payload** including `totalPoolSize`.
- **Connections page — Country filter persists across poll ticks** — `conn:update` re-applies the active country filter.
- **Connections page — map buttons work on desktop and mobile** — `mousedown` / `touchstart` handlers skip `preventDefault` for button targets.

### Fixed

- **Firewall rule metadata wiped on counter update** — `_applyUpdate` now merges stream deltas into existing rules rather than replacing them, preserving chain/action/comment.
- **Mangle rules excluded from dirty-check fp** — mangle counter changes now trigger `firewall:update` emit.
- **`[bandwidth] no such item (4)` log noise** — transient RouterOS error suppressed.
- **DHCP subnets card — Leases column overflow on mobile** — `white-space:nowrap` removed; `table-layout:fixed` added.
- **IP Utilisation gauge sub-label removed**.
- **Connections page — Sankey filter flag fixed** — deselecting a country no longer permanently freezes the Sankey.


## [0.5.14] — Optimisations, alert thresholds & bug fixes

### Added

- **Persistent alert thresholds** — CPU spike and ping loss notification thresholds are now configurable in Settings rather than hardcoded. Two sliders in a new "Alert Thresholds" card let you set the CPU % (default 90) and ping loss % (default 100) that trigger browser notifications. Values are stored in `settings.json` and broadcast to all connected clients via `settings:pages` so thresholds take effect immediately without a page refresh.
- **Timestamped Docker log output** — all console output is now prefixed with a local-time timestamp in the format `[2026-03-20 09:39:34]`, making `docker logs mikrodash` immediately readable without needing `docker logs --timestamps`.

### Changed

- **Idle-gating extended to four more collectors** — `ConnectionsCollector`, `BandwidthCollector`, `TopTalkersCollector`, and `WirelessCollector` now skip their `tick()` entirely when no browser clients are connected, matching the existing behaviour of `TrafficCollector`. On a quiet network with no dashboard open, RouterOS API traffic drops to near zero.
- **`connTableCache` TTL raised from 40% to 90% of the faster poll interval** — the shared firewall connection table cache used by both `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` now stays valid for almost a full poll cycle of the faster collector, halving redundant RouterOS API calls when both collectors run at similar intervals.
- **Ping count reduced from 3 to 2** — each `/tool/ping` tick now sends 2 ICMP packets instead of 3, saving ~200ms of RouterOS API hold time per 10-second poll cycle with no meaningful loss of RTT accuracy.
- **Dirty-check fingerprinting added to five collectors** — `ConnectionsCollector`, `BandwidthCollector`, `TopTalkersCollector`, `DhcpNetworksCollector`, and `PingCollector` now suppress socket emits when their computed payload is identical to the previous tick. On stable networks this eliminates most redundant browser re-renders.
- **`stop()` method added to all collectors** — all 15 collectors now have a public `stop()` method. `teardownSession()` and `shutdown()` in `index.js` now call `c.stop()` uniformly rather than reaching into each collector's internal timer or stream fields.
- **`PingCollector` history uses `RingBuffer`** — the ping history ring buffer is now the same `RingBuffer` class used by `TrafficCollector`, replacing the plain array with manual `shift()`.
- **Unused `ArpCollector` import removed** from `test/collector-lifecycle.test.js`.

### Fixed

- **Ping target label not updating after router settings change** — editing the Ping Target in the Router card and saving now immediately broadcasts a `ping:update` to all connected clients so the dashboard label updates at once. Previously the label only changed after the next scheduled poll cycle (up to 10 seconds later). The fix is in the `PUT /api/routers/:id` handler, which is the correct save path for router-level settings including `pingTarget`.


## [0.5.13] — Wireless single-device display fix

### Fixed

- **Wireless page showing only one device on startup** — the 500ms name-resolution retry introduced in v0.5.12 was calling `tick()` again, which made a second RouterOS API call to the registration table. Some RouterOS firmware builds return partial results (1 of N clients) when the wifi registration table is queried within the first few seconds after boot — the same firmware sensitivity that caused the original `=.proplist=` single-client bug. The retry now re-resolves names from the already-fetched raw client rows stored in the closure rather than making any RouterOS API call, then re-emits only if names changed. If DHCP still hasn't loaded after 500ms the retry reschedules itself until all names are resolved.


## [0.5.12] — Wireless device names fix

### Fixed

- **Wireless page showing MAC addresses instead of device names** — `WirelessCollector.resolveName()` was caching empty strings when DHCP leases had not yet loaded on startup. Since `wireless.start()` fires before `dhcpLeases.start()` completes, the first tick resolved every MAC to `''` and stored it in `_nameCache`. All subsequent ticks hit the cache and never retried the DHCP lookup, so names were permanently blank. Fixed by only caching non-empty results: `if (name) this._nameCache.set(mac, name)`. Additionally, `name` is now included in the dirty-check fingerprint so the first tick that gains a resolved name triggers a socket emit to the browser even when MAC, signal, iface and band are unchanged.


## [0.5.11] — Bandwidth page flash fix

### Fixed

- **Bandwidth page alternating zeros/real-data flash** — `BandwidthCollector` and `ConnectionsCollector` had a double-start bug introduced in v0.5.10. Moving `ros.on('connected')` listeners to the constructor meant the handler fired on the initial connect and called `stop()` + `start()` — while `startCollectors()` in `index.js` *also* called `start()` explicitly on that same event. Two concurrent `setInterval` loops were created, interleaving ticks at roughly half the configured poll interval. The first tick of each pair always had a sparse `_prev` baseline (near-zero byte deltas → near-zero rates); the second had a full interval's worth of data. This produced the visible flash. Fixed by adding a `_started` flag to both collectors: the `connected` handler now only restarts the poll loop after a genuine reconnect (when `_started` is already true), leaving the initial start entirely to `startCollectors()`.


## [0.5.10] — Housekeeping & Test Suite Repair

### Fixed

- **`ConnectionsCollector` missing `stop()` method** — added canonical `stop()` that clears the poll timer. `ros.on('close')` and `ros.on('connected')` listeners are now registered once in the constructor rather than on every `start()` call, eliminating the risk of listener accumulation across reconnect cycles.
- **`BandwidthCollector` missing `stop()` method** — same fix as above. Cache maps (`_prev`, `_geoCache`, `_orgCache`, `_ifaceCache`) are still cleared on reconnect from the constructor listener.
- **`setInterval`-before-`run()` ordering in `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector`** — the poll timer is now set before the first `run()` call so the `close` event handler can always find and clear it, even if `run()` resolves synchronously in tests.
- **`BandwidthCollector` not writing to shared state** — `state.lastBandwidthTs` and `state.lastBandwidthErr` are now updated on every tick, consistent with all other collectors. `_freshState()` in `index.js` initialises both fields.
- **58 pre-existing test failures in `collector-data-transforms.test.js`** — all resolved:
  - Traffic tests: added missing `io.engine.clientsCount` to stubs.
  - Connections test: added `orgs: []` to `topCountries` deep-equal expected values (field was added in v0.5.8 but test was never updated).
  - Firewall, VPN, InterfaceStatus, ARP tests: these collectors were converted to streaming in prior sessions; tests were still calling the removed `tick()` method. Rewritten to call `_loadInitial()` (the correct entry point) with a minimal `stream` stub.
  - ARP tests: `getByIP`/`getByMAC` return `null` for missing entries; assertions corrected from `undefined` to `null`.
  - Wireless band test: band detection was refactored to read the RouterOS `band` field directly; test updated to supply that field in the ROS row stub.
  - Routing tests: `RoutingCollector` was used in 45 tests but never imported at the top of the routing section.
- **4 pre-existing test failures in `collector-lifecycle.test.js`** — all resolved:
  - Tests using `ArpCollector` as a "generic polling collector" subject: `ArpCollector` was converted to streaming in a prior session and no longer has `tick()` or a poll timer. Replaced with `DhcpNetworksCollector` (still polling) with a minimal `dhcpLeases` stub.
  - Inflight-reset test: rewrote to assert the correct contract (all collectors catch errors in `tick()` internally; `_inflight` must still reset after a failed tick).
- **1 pre-existing test failure in `smoke-fixes.test.js`** — `ROS emitter tolerates error events without a custom listener` was calling `ros.emit('error', ...)` directly, which is the standard Node.js `EventEmitter` throw path. Fixed to call `ros._emitConnectionError()` — the guarded method that only forwards to `error` when a listener exists.

### Added

- **14 new lifecycle tests** for `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` (added in the same session as the production fixes): `stop()` existence and idempotency, close-event teardown, connected-event restart, listener non-accumulation across reconnects, inflight guard, and state timestamp/error tracking.

## [0.5.9] — Multi-Router Support

### Added

- **Multi-router management** — MikroDash can now connect to and monitor multiple MikroTik routers from a single instance. A new **Routers card** in Settings replaces the old Router Connection card. All configured routers are listed in a table with Edit and Delete actions. An **Add Router** button opens a modal with a full connection form (host, port, username, password, TLS, WAN interface, ping target, display name) and a **Test Connection** button that validates credentials against the live router before saving — on success the board name is automatically filled into the display name field.
- **Live router switcher** — a styled dropdown in the top-right of the page header (green pill with status dot) shows the currently active router and allows switching. On mobile, the same selector appears inside the slide-out navigation menu. Selecting a different router triggers an in-process hot-swap with no container restart or browser disconnect.
- **`/data/routers.json`** — new persistence file on the Docker data volume. Router passwords are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM using the same `DATA_SECRET`-derived key as `settings.json`. Existing deployments are migrated automatically: if `routers.json` does not exist on first start, a single entry is seeded from the existing `settings.json` credentials — no manual steps required.
- **Auto-labelling from board name** — newly added routers default to "My Router". After the first successful connection, MikroDash automatically updates the display name to the RouterOS board name (e.g. "hAP ax³"). The label is cleaned of ROS version suffixes before storage.
- **Name uniqueness** — if a display name already exists, a numeric suffix is appended: "hAP ax³ - [2]", "hAP ax³ - [3]", etc.
- **RouterOS update check resilience** — devices that cannot reach the MikroTik upgrade server (e.g. CAPsMAN-managed APs, restricted network positions) now show "Update check unavailable" in the System card instead of remaining stuck on "Checking for updates…" indefinitely.
- **Mobile navigation router selector** — the router switcher dropdown is included inside the mobile slide-out nav menu, visible only on small screens where the topbar selector is hidden.
- **Mobile burger menu toggle** — tapping the burger icon a second time now closes the navigation menu (previously it only opened it).

### Changed

- **In-process hot-swap on router switch** — switching routers tears down the active RouterOS connection and all 15 collectors, builds a fresh session for the new router, and begins connecting — all in-process in ~150ms. The Socket.IO server and HTTP server stay live throughout. All connected browser tabs receive fresh data from the new router automatically without a page refresh, including traffic history, DHCP leases, LAN overview, and all collector snapshots.
- **Router connection settings removed from Settings API** — host, port, credentials, and WAN interface are now managed exclusively through the Routers card and `/api/routers` endpoints. The global Settings validator no longer accepts these fields.
- **`settings.json` schema** — `activeRouterId` field added. Stores the UUID of the currently active router. Existing files remain valid.
- **Wireless poll interval maximum raised to 60 seconds** — previously capped at 30 seconds.
- **Poll interval sliders reordered** — Ping now appears above Wireless in the Settings poll interval section.
- **TLS toggle auto-fills port** — toggling Use TLS on/off in the Add/Edit Router modal now automatically fills the API port field (8729 for TLS, 8728 for plain), unless a custom port has already been entered.
- **Security guidance in `AI_CONTEXT.md`** — expanded Security model section with prescriptive requirements for new development: endpoint auth, input validation, credential handling, `.env` vs Settings boundary, frontend XSS rules, and dependency policy.

### Fixed

- **Traffic card goes stale after router switch** — after a hot-swap the server now broadcasts `sendInitialState` to all connected sockets once the new router's collectors are running. Previously, existing Socket.IO connections never received a new `traffic:history` event (only new connections did), leaving the chart blank until a manual page refresh.
- **DHCP page not updated after router switch** — same root cause as the traffic card; resolved by the same `sendInitialState` broadcast.
- **LAN overview (Network card) not updated after router switch** — `dhcpNetworks.tick()` is now awaited before `sendInitialState` broadcasts so `networks` and `wanIp` are populated immediately. Client-side `lastLanData` guard cleared on switch so incoming data is never silently discarded.
- **Destination Countries count not reset after router switch** — the connections map IIFE now clears its internal country caches and the card subtitle on `router:switching`, preventing old router's country count from persisting.
- **Router dropdown showing ROS version info** — the `system:update` handler was overwriting the select option text with `boardName + ' · ROS ' + version` on every system poll. Removed. The dropdown now only ever uses the stored label from `routers.json`. A strip regex also guards against stale labels already on disk.


## [0.5.8] — Routing & Wireless: Full Streaming, Interface Sparklines

### Added

- **Interface page sparklines** — each interface card now shows a traffic trend sparkline in the top-right corner. Plots combined RX+TX Mbps over the last 30 samples (~2.5 minutes at default 5 s poll). Baseline-anchored at zero. Inline SVG, no additional data source required.
- **Streaming-first architecture** — all collectors that support a RouterOS `/listen` endpoint now use event-driven streaming instead of polling. New constraint documented in `AI_CONTEXT.md`.

### Changed

- **`RoutingCollector` fully converted to streaming** — both the route table and BGP sessions are now event-driven with no poll timer:
  - `/ip/route/listen` — route table maintained as an in-memory `Map`, updated incrementally by delta rows (add/update/delete). Partial delta rows are merged with the stored raw row so unmodified fields are preserved.
  - `/routing/bgp/session/listen` — BGP session state delivered instantly. Keepalive-only events (uptime/counter tick with unchanged state and prefix count) are fingerprint-suppressed to avoid unnecessary browser re-renders.
  - `/routing/bgp/peer/print` — peer config (names, descriptions) loaded once on connect; refreshed only when a meaningful session state change is detected.
  - 60-second heartbeat re-emit keeps client stale timers alive on stable networks.
  - Graceful fallback when BGP stream endpoint is unavailable (RouterOS v6, non-BGP builds).
- **Routing poll interval slider removed from Settings** — replaced with an "Event-driven" badge, consistent with Interfaces, VPN, Firewall, and ARP.
- **`AI_CONTEXT.md` expanded** — collector delivery model table added; RouterOS API quirks section added; streaming collector pattern documented as the default with polling as the explicit fallback.

### Fixed

- **Wireless page shows only one client** — `=.proplist=` on the wifi/wireless registration-table calls was causing some RouterOS v7 firmware builds to *filter rows* (returning only rows where all requested fields are non-empty) rather than silently omitting absent fields. Only the one client that happened to satisfy the full proplist was returned. Fix: `=.proplist=` removed from both registration-table calls.
- **Routing page data disappears after first poll or reconnect** — `start()` was registering a new `ros.on('connected')` listener on every call, doubling the count on each reconnect cycle (1→2→4→8→…). After a few reconnects multiple concurrent chains raced to call `stop()`, each clearing the timer the previous chain had just created. Fixed by registering listeners exactly once — same pattern as all other collectors.
- **Active routes disappear, one disabled route remains** — RouterOS v7 omits `.flags` for routes in their default active state on some firmware builds; disabled routes always carry `.flags`. Streaming via `/ip/route/listen` eliminates the inconsistency as stream events always carry the full row.
- **Connected routes flicker in the routes table every poll cycle** — the IP-gateway fallback inference passed for RouterOS interface-name gateways (`bridge`, `ether1`, `vlan10`). Fixed by requiring the gateway to match an actual IP address pattern.
- **`pollTalkers` live interval change had no effect** — `talkers` was missing from `collectorMap` in the settings POST handler.
- **`settings:pages` missing fields** — `sendInitialState()` omitted `pageBandwidth`; the settings reset branch omitted both `pageBandwidth` and `pageRouting`.
- **Malformed RouterOS field values produced `NaN`** — all numeric field conversions now use a `safeInt()` helper that returns `0` for non-numeric strings.


## [0.5.7] — Routing Page, BGP Monitoring, arm64 Support & Fixes

### Added

- **Routing page** — new sidebar page covering the full router routing state:
  - **Routes by Protocol card** — doughnut chart (Static / Dynamic / BGP / OSPF) embedded in the card alongside a count grid. Connected routes shown in the grid but excluded from the chart.
  - **Static & Dynamic Routes table** — sortable, filterable table with destination, gateway, distance, active state, type badge, and comment.
  - **BGP Peers table** — per-peer session state, ASN, uptime, prefix count, updates in/out, last error, and a per-peer prefix trend sparkline. Sortable by all columns. Filterable by state, peer type (Upstream / IX / Private), and IPv4/IPv6. Full-text search.
  - **BGP Peers summary card** — total, established, and down peer counts.
  - **Peer type classification** — peers auto-classified as Upstream, IX/Route-Server, or Private using RFC6996 ASN ranges and description keywords.
  - **Session flap detection** — 3+ state transitions within 5 minutes marks a peer as flapping with a pulsing badge.
  - **BGP alert notifications** — peer down/up, prefix count change ≥20%, session flapping, and hold-timer warnings integrated into the existing notification system.
  - **`pollRouting` setting** — dedicated poll interval slider (1s–10min) in Settings. Defaults to 10s.
- **DHCP page sortable columns** — Hostname, IP, MAC, and Status columns now sortable with sort arrows. Default sort is IP ascending.
- **`pollTalkers` setting** — Top Talkers has its own independent poll interval, no longer tied to Connections.
- **Routing nav badge** — live total route count shown next to Routing in the sidebar.

### Performance & Reliability

- **Routing API efficiency** — all route data (type classification, counts, table rows) derived from a single `/ip/route/print` call using RouterOS `.flags` string parsing. Eliminates up to 8 concurrent API writes per tick that were causing intermittent ROS disconnects.
- **Route flag parsing** — uses RouterOS's compact `.flags` string (`A`=active, `S`=static, `D`=dynamic, `b`=bgp, `o`=ospf) with fallback to individual boolean fields. Reliable across all RouterOS v7 builds — previous `?static=yes` / `?dynamic=yes` filter approach returned inconsistent results on some firmware versions.
- **WAN IP on first load** — falls back to extracting the WAN IP from interface status data when the DHCP Networks collector hasn't completed its first tick yet.

### Docker

- **`linux/arm64` support** — multi-arch image (`linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`) published via GitHub Actions on every `v*.*.*` tag. Covers Raspberry Pi 4/5, R5S, and Apple M-series. QEMU used for cross-compilation; native layers at runtime.
- **`.dockerignore` added** — reduces image build context size.

### Bug Fixes

- **DHCP Networks poll interval** — server-side validator now accepts values up to 10 minutes, matching the Settings UI slider.
- **Routing page dropdowns** — search and select inputs now correctly follow the dark/light theme using CSS variables with `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides.
- **Routing stale cards** — stale thresholds now sync from `pollRouting` via the settings payload before the first data event arrives, preventing premature stale state on slow-polling configurations.


## [0.5.6] — Streaming Architecture, Router CPU Optimisations & Bug Fixes

### Streaming — event-driven collectors (replaces polling)

Four collectors converted from fixed-interval polling to RouterOS `/listen` streams.
Each opens a persistent stream on connect, receives only delta rows when something
changes, and falls back to a full `/print` reload on stream error. A 60-second
heartbeat emit keeps stale-detection timers alive when data is stable.

- **Firewall** (`/ip/firewall/filter/listen`, `/nat/listen`, `/mangle/listen`) —
  three concurrent streams replace the 10-second poll. Rule changes and counter
  updates appear instantly. Eliminates 18 API calls/min at default interval.
- **VPN / WireGuard** (`/interface/wireguard/peers/listen`) — stream fires on
  handshake and byte-counter updates. Eliminates 6 API calls/min.
- **Interface Status** (`/interface/listen`) — stream fires on up/down state
  changes for instant tile colour updates. A lightweight 5-second stats poll
  (scoped to counter fields only) runs in parallel to drive the live rate bars,
  since byte counters are not pushed through the listen stream.
- **ARP** (`/ip/arp/listen`) — stream fires when devices appear, disappear, or
  change MAC binding. Eliminates 2 API calls/min; new devices now appear
  instantly rather than within the previous 30-second poll window.

### Performance — `.proplist` field scoping

RouterOS sends all available fields per row unless told otherwise. Added
`=.proplist=` to every remaining unscoped collector to request only the fields
MikroDash actually reads, reducing per-call payload size:

- **Connection table cache** — 7 fields requested instead of ~15 per entry.
  With large connection tables (hundreds to thousands of entries polled at 3s)
  this is the single largest wire-traffic reduction.
- **Interface Status** — scoped to 10 fields for `/interface/print` and 2 for
  `/ip/address/print`.
- **Top Talkers** — scoped to 4 fields for `/ip/kid-control/device/print`.
- **System** — scoped to 11 fields for `/system/resource/print`.
- **Wireless** — scoped to 12 fields for both registration table APIs
  (`/interface/wifi/registration-table/print` and
  `/interface/wireless/registration-table/print`).

### Performance — additional optimisations

- **Socket.IO `perMessageDeflate`** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled at
  compression level 1. Repetitive JSON payloads (connection tables, interface
  lists) typically compress 60–80%.
- **Shared connection table cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and
  `BandwidthCollector` share a single `/ip/firewall/connection/print` fetch
  per cycle. Cache TTL is now **40% of the faster collector's poll interval**
  (previously a fixed 1500ms) so it works correctly at any poll rate including
  1-second bandwidth polling.
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — `/interface/monitor-traffic` API calls
  are skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected
  (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`). Eliminates 60 API calls/min when the
  dashboard is unattended.
- **Firewall / VPN / wireless emit fingerprinting** — socket emits suppressed
  when payload content is unchanged between ticks.
- **System collector** — `/system/package/update/print` decoupled from the
  resource/health tick into a separate background call with a 5-minute
  sub-interval. RouterOS must reach its update server to resolve this call;
  previously this blocked CPU/RAM gauges from appearing on first load.
  Update status now emits independently when it resolves.
- **`system:update` static metadata written once** — board name, ROS version,
  CPU count/frequency, and total RAM never change after boot. `sysMeta`
  is now written to the DOM on the first payload only; subsequent ticks update
  only the dynamic fields (gauges, uptime, temperature).
- **`ts` excluded from client-side connection fingerprints** — previously the
  `ts` timestamp caused fingerprint mismatches on every tick regardless of
  whether data changed.
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gated** — bandwidth stat card and chart
  sync only run when the bandwidth page is active.
- **Country list server-side cap** — `conn:update` slices `topCountries` to
  30 entries before emitting.

### Settings page — poll intervals

- **Streamed collectors** (Interfaces, VPN, Firewall, ARP) no longer show
  editable sliders — replaced with a green **"Event-driven"** badge since their
  data delivery is not controlled by a poll interval.
- **Poll interval sliders reordered** — all configurable (polled) collectors
  listed first, event-driven badges grouped below.
- **`pollTalkers`** added as an independent setting for the Top Talkers card.
  Previously it was silently tied to the Connections interval with no way to
  control it separately.

### Bug Fixes

- **Interfaces page traffic counters not updating** — `/interface/listen` fires
  only on structural changes (up/down), not on byte-counter increments. The
  stats poll now fetches counter fields on the configured interval and merges
  them into the stored interface rows, restoring live rate bars.
- **WireGuard card stale on dashboard** — streamed collectors have no regular
  emit cadence when data is unchanged (e.g. idle peers). All three streamed
  collectors (firewall, VPN, ifStatus) now emit a 60-second heartbeat so the
  stale-detection timer never fires while the stream is healthy. Stale
  thresholds for these cards raised to 90s.
- **Bandwidth table blank on every other tick at 1s poll** — fixed cache TTL
  mismatch: the shared connection table cache had a fixed 1500ms TTL, so at
  1s bandwidth polling every second tick returned the same cached rows, making
  all byte deltas zero. TTL is now 40% of the minimum poll interval.
- **"Checking for updates" stuck on dashboard** — `/system/package/update/print`
  was bundled into the first resource/health tick. RouterOS must reach its
  update server to resolve this, blocking CPU/RAM gauges from appearing.
  Update check now runs in the background and never delays the gauge emit.
- **WAN IP slow to appear on page load** — `sendInitialState` emitted
  `lan:overview` without the `wanIp` field. The IP is now included from the
  cached `state.lastWanIp` value so it appears immediately on connect.
- **Top Talkers poll interval uncontrollable** — talkers was constructed with
  `pollMs: _cfg.pollConns` and had no entry in the live poll-update map.
  Changing the Connections slider silently moved both; there was no way to set
  them independently. Now has its own `pollTalkers` setting.

## [0.5.5] — Bandwidth Page, Performance & Reliability

### Added
- **Bandwidth page** — new dedicated page showing live per-connection bandwidth, accessible from the sidebar. Displays all active firewall connections with real-time RX, TX, and Total Mbps, sortable by any column (default: Total descending)
- **Compact WAN traffic chart** — a 120 px inline Chart.js graph sits above the bandwidth table, mirroring the dashboard traffic feed with no extra API calls
- **RX / TX stat card** — a combined card beside the chart shows live WAN receive and transmit rates, split into value and unit spans for stable right-aligned layout
- **ASN / Org column on Bandwidth page** — uses the same `svcBadge()` colour coding as the Connections page (CDN blue, cloud orange, social purple, etc.)
- **Destination column with geo flag** — shows country flag, ISO code, and city; city is suppressed when it duplicates the country code or is a single character
- **Interface column** — resolved server-side via subnet CIDR matching against the live interface list; no RouterOS field read needed
- **Interface dropdown filter** — seeded from all running interfaces via `ifstatus:update`; DOM only rebuilds when the sorted list actually changes, eliminating per-tick flicker
- **Search + dropdown toolbar** — search box expands to fill all available space; interface and protocol dropdowns are pinned to the right
- **`pollBandwidth` and `pageBandwidth` settings** — both fields were previously silently dropped by the settings validator; both are now accepted and applied correctly

### Performance
- **Shared `/ip/firewall/connection/print` cache** — `ConnectionsCollector` and `BandwidthCollector` previously each fetched the full connection table independently every 3 s (~40 API calls/min combined). Both now read from a shared 1.5 s TTL cache in `index.js`, halving RouterOS API load. Cache is invalidated on disconnect
- **Traffic collector idle-gating** — the 1 s `/interface/monitor-traffic` poll is skipped entirely when no browser clients are connected (`io.engine.clientsCount === 0`), eliminating 60 API calls/min when the dashboard is unattended. The interval continues running so data resumes immediately on reconnect
- **`perMessageDeflate` on Socket.IO** — WebSocket per-message deflate enabled (compression level 1) reducing repetitive JSON payload sizes by 60–80% with negligible CPU overhead
- **Fingerprint-gate on `firewall`, `vpn`, and `wireless` emits** — each collector computes a lightweight fingerprint over its structural data before emitting; the socket write is suppressed when nothing has changed. Firewall rules and VPN peers are stable for hours at a time
- **`_resolveIface` result cache** — bandwidth collector caches subnet-to-interface resolution per source IP in a `Map`, cleared on reconnect. Eliminates repeated CIDR iteration for the same stable LAN hosts every tick
- **Server-side country list cap** — `conn:update` now slices `topCountries` to 30 entries before emitting; the client never renders more than this
- **`ts` excluded from client-side fingerprints** — connection source and destination fingerprints previously hashed the full object including `ts`, which changes every tick regardless of data. Fingerprints now hash only the meaningful fields
- **`_updateBwStats` page-visibility gate** — bandwidth RX/TX stat card and chart sync only run when the bandwidth page is active

### Bug Fixes
- **Interfaces page stale** — `InterfaceStatusCollector` was fingerprint-suppressing emits when interface up/down state and IPs were unchanged. Because rates change every tick, the stale timer never reset and the page marked itself stale after ~25 s. The collector now always emits unconditionally
- **Bandwidth table columns shifting on refresh** — added `table-layout:fixed` and a `<colgroup>` with explicit percentage widths for all 8 columns. Cells receive `overflow:hidden; text-overflow:ellipsis` so long content truncates within the fixed width rather than pushing columns
- **`fmtMbps` HTML injection in bandwidth stat card** — a local `fmtMbps` inside the bandwidth IIFE returned a `<span>` string for zero values; the card used `textContent` so the raw HTML rendered as literal text. Local override removed; global plain-text version handles all cases
- **`networksCard` false-stale** — stale grace period widened from 20 s to 45 s (300 s poll × 15%) to accommodate slow RouterOS DHCP responses. The stale timer now also resets on `ping:update` (every 10 s), since the card displays live ping data and should never appear stale while the router is reachable

### UI
- **Page-wide disconnect fade** — when either the Socket.IO connection or the RouterOS connection drops and the reconnecting banner appears, the entire page (`#sidenav` and `#main`) fades to 35% opacity with `pointer-events:none` and a 0.35 s transition, matching the visual language of individual stale cards. Cleared immediately on reconnect

## [0.5.4] — Performance, Settings & DHCP Improvements

### Added
- **Settings page** — new page accessible via a gear icon pinned to the bottom of the sidebar; About moved below Settings
- **Persistent settings store** (`src/settings.js`) — saves to `/data/settings.json` on the Docker volume; merges over `.env` values on boot so existing deployments are unaffected
- **AES-256-GCM credential encryption** — router password and dashboard password are encrypted at rest using a key derived from the `DATA_SECRET` env var
- **`GET /api/settings`** — returns current settings with credentials masked as `••••••••`
- **`POST /api/settings`** — validates and saves settings; applies poll interval changes live without restart; broadcasts page visibility changes to all connected clients; returns `requiresRestart: true` if router connection fields changed
- **Live poll interval sliders** — all collector poll intervals adjustable via range sliders; changes take effect immediately without restart
- **Page visibility toggles** — any page except Dashboard and Settings can be hidden; hidden pages are removed from the sidebar instantly; active page redirects to Dashboard if hidden
- **Router connection settings** — host, port, username, password, TLS toggle, self-signed cert toggle, default WAN interface, ping target
- **Dashboard auth settings** — HTTP Basic Auth username and password configurable from the UI
- **Limits settings** — Top N connections/talkers/firewall rules, max connections, traffic history minutes
- **Reset to defaults** button — restores all settings to compiled-in defaults
- **Docker volume** — `docker-compose.yml` now mounts a named `mikrodash-data` volume at `/data`

### Changed
- **Boot from settings** — `index.js` reads router credentials and all poll intervals from the settings store on startup; `.env` vars still seed the defaults if no `settings.json` exists yet
- **DHCP Networks poll default raised to 5 min (300,000 ms)** — network definitions and WAN IP are static config that rarely change; lease counts are derived from the in-memory store so are unaffected. Slider range updated to 30 s – 10 min; `.env.example` updated to match
- **Merged duplicate socket listeners** — `ifstatus:update`, `vpn:update`, `system:update`, and `ping:update` each previously registered two handlers (render + notification); consolidated into single handlers
- **`system:update` dirty-checking** — gauges, sys-meta, and update row fingerprinted; DOM only rebuilt when values change
- **`ifstatus:update` dirty-checking** — interface grid skips full `innerHTML` rewrite when name/state/rates are unchanged
- **Wireless dirty-checking** — wireless table skips rebuild when MAC/signal/tx-rate/uptime are unchanged
- **`renderCountryList` dirty-checking** — skips rewrite when data and selection are unchanged
- **`renderPortList` dirty-checking** — skips rebuild when data is unchanged
- **Page-visibility gating** — country/port lists, interface grid, wireless table, and firewall table skip all DOM work when the tab is hidden or the relevant page is not active
- **Log count badge debounce** — `updateLogCounts()` debounced to 250 ms during rapid log bursts
- **Map tooltip `getBoundingClientRect()` cached** — rect cached per hover session, invalidated on resize; eliminates a forced layout reflow on every `mousemove`
- **Map pulse animation via `rAF` double-frame** — replaces forced synchronous reflow used to restart CSS animations
- **Per-tick GeoIP dedup** (`connections.js`) — `geoLookup()` called at most once per unique destination IP per tick
- **Wireless MAC name cache** (`wireless.js`) — `getNameByMAC()` result cached between ticks in a `Map`; cleared on reconnect

### Server
- **Event-driven DHCP lease updates** (`dhcpLeases.js`) — removed 15-second periodic `leases:list` broadcast; `_applyLease` now emits an updated lease table immediately on any change from the live stream; `_loadInitial` emits once after startup `/print`
- **Removed `pollMs` from `DhcpLeasesCollector`** — no longer accepts a poll interval; `LEASES_POLL_MS` env var has no effect and can be removed from `.env`
## [0.5.3] — UI & Accuracy Improvements

### Features

- **Per-band wireless client counts** — the Wireless Clients card header now
  shows live counts per band (`2.4GHz: N`, `5GHz: N`, and `6GHz: N` when
  present), separated from the total count badge by a thin vertical divider
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ASN / org lookup on Connections page** — destination IPs are resolved to
  organisation names via a curated CIDR→org table with a 5000-entry LRU cache,
  displayed as a label beneath each IP:port entry; no new runtime dependencies
  (`src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`,
  `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colour coding** — destinations are grouped into seven
  categories (cdn, cloud, social, streaming, messaging, video, dns) with
  distinct coloured inline badges in Top Destinations, org sub-rows in Top
  Countries, and IP tooltips on hover (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `src/util/asnLookup.js`, `src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Connection Flow Sankey diagram** — a pure-SVG source→destination flow
  diagram rendered at the bottom of the Connections page, driven by
  `conn:update` data, with proportional ribbon widths, category colours, and
  resize-awareness; no external library (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count indicators** — four clickable severity pill badges (`N errors`,
  `N warnings`, `N info`, `N debug`) in the Logs card header tally the buffer
  by severity, toggle the severity filter on click, and remain visible at zero
  count (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Wireless band detection uses RouterOS registration table directly** —
  the previous heuristic based on interface name patterns and tx-rate strings
  (`MHT-xxx`, `HE-MCS`) incorrectly reported 5GHz for some 2.4GHz clients.
  The collector now reads the `band` field directly from each registration
  table entry — the same authoritative source Winbox displays in its Band
  column (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)
- **Ping target label updates dynamically** — `<span id="pingTargetLabel">`
  is now updated from `data.target` in both `ping:history` and `ping:update`
  handlers (`public/app.js`)
- **Wired client count uses interface type allowlist** — count now derives
  from `type === 'ether'` entries in `ifstatus:update` rather than the talkers
  list, avoiding false positives (`public/app.js`)

### UI

- **Connections page layout reorganised** — Top Countries now spans the full
  page width; Connection Flow and Top Ports share the row below it at a
  `2fr 1fr` split (`public/index.html`)
- **Sankey diagram taller** — minimum height raised from 180px to 260px and
  per-source row height increased from 24px to 36px (`public/app.js`)
- **Service badge colours fully distinct** — `svc-video` changed from blue
  (conflicting with `svc-cdn`) to amber; `svc-dns` changed from green
  (conflicting with `svc-messaging`) to teal; Sankey ribbon colours updated
  to match (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log count badges more visible** — background and text opacities raised
  across all four severity levels; debug badge no longer uses the near-invisible
  `--text-muted` colour (`public/index.html`)
- **Country list sparklines moved to top-right** — the per-country sparkline
  is repositioned to the top-right of the country name row using a flex
  space-between wrapper (`public/app.js`)
- **Nav logo no longer jumps on expand/collapse** — logo previously switched
  between `justify-content:center` and `flex-start` mid-transition; it now
  sits permanently left-aligned with `padding:0 14px`, matching the nav icons,
  with no animated properties (`public/index.html`)
- **Traffic card width on mobile fixed** — removed a redundant inner wrapper
  div that caused the Traffic card to render slightly narrower than sibling
  cards on mobile viewports (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile topbar decluttered** — clock and router tag spans hidden at ≤767px
  via `.topbar-mobile-hide` (`public/index.html`)
- **Mobile dashboard scaling** — `.page-view` padding reduced on small screens;
  grid gaps tightened; connections card set to `height:auto` on narrow
  viewports; `connMapList` grid uses `minmax(min(220px,100%),1fr)` to prevent
  horizontal overflow (`public/index.html`)

## [0.5.2] — UI Improvements & Bug Fixes

### Features

- **Live interface traffic rates on Interfaces page** — each interface tile now
  displays real-time RX and TX rates with colour-coded bar indicators (blue for
  RX, green for TX) that scale relative to the session peak. Rates are derived
  from cumulative byte counter deltas between polls, since
  `rx-bits-per-second` is not available from `/interface/print`
  (`src/collectors/interfaceStatus.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Log persistence across page refreshes** — the server now maintains a
  ring buffer of the last 500 log entries (configurable via `LOG_HISTORY_SIZE`)
  and replays them to each new socket connection, so the Logs page is no longer
  blank after a refresh (`src/collectors/logs.js`, `src/index.js`,
  `public/app.js`)
- **Self-hosted fonts** — JetBrains Mono and Syne are now bundled as woff2
  files under `public/vendor/fonts/`, eliminating the last remaining external
  requests to Google Fonts and completing the fully air-gapped deployment story
  (`public/vendor/fonts/`, `public/index.html`)

### UI

- **Item count badges on Interfaces and VPN pages** — the Interfaces card and
  the WireGuard Peers card now show a count badge matching the style used on
  Wireless Clients and DHCP (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **Consistent card badge styling across all pages** — all five card badges
  (Wireless Clients, DHCP, WireGuard dashboard, WireGuard Peers, Interfaces)
  now use a shared `.card-badge` CSS class with CSS variable-based colours that
  are legible in both dark and light mode, replacing the Tabler `bg-*` classes
  that were invisible in light mode (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Notification bell invisible in light mode** — the bell SVG had an inline
  `stroke:var(--text-muted)` overriding `currentColor`, a blanket `opacity:.85`
  on the button, and no explicit `width`/`height` on dynamically injected SVGs,
  causing it to be nearly invisible or zero-sized. All three issues resolved
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)
- **ROS and reconnect banners stacking** — when the router disconnected,
  both the amber RouterOS banner and the red Socket.IO reconnect banner could
  appear simultaneously. The reconnect banner now suppresses the ROS banner
  while active, and restores it on reconnect only if the router is still
  offline (`public/app.js`)
- **VPN peer dot hidden on long peer names** — the status dot in WireGuard
  peer tiles was clipped when the peer name was long due to `overflow:hidden`
  applied to the flex container. The dot is now `flex-shrink:0` and truncation
  applies only to the name text span (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.5.1] — Production Resilience Hardening

### Security

- **Self-hosted frontend assets and tightened CSP** — the dashboard now serves
  vendored Chart.js, TopoJSON, world-atlas, and Tabler assets locally instead
  of loading them from third-party CDNs. Helmet configuration was extracted
  into a dedicated module and tightened to a self-hosted Content Security
  Policy (`src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `public/index.html`, `public/app.js`,
  `public/vendor/`)
- **Startup patch verification for `node-routeros`** — application startup now
  hard-fails if the required MikroDash compatibility markers are missing from
  the patched `node-routeros` files, preventing silent boot with a broken
  runtime (`src/index.js`)
- **Socket.IO connection cap** — the server now applies a configurable
  `MAX_SOCKETS` limit and caps Socket.IO message size, reducing abuse surface
  on LAN deployments (`src/index.js`)

### Reliability

- **Per-command RouterOS write timeout with forced reconnect** — one-shot
  RouterOS API calls now use a configurable timeout budget
  (`ROS_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS`) and close the active shared connection on timeout so
  the existing reconnect loop can recover cleanly (`src/routeros/client.js`)
- **Inflight guards across polling collectors** — all interval-based
  collectors now skip overlapping runs instead of stacking concurrent RouterOS
  calls when a slow tick exceeds its poll interval (`src/collectors/*.js`)
- **Graceful shutdown with unref’d fallback timer** — shutdown now stops
  RouterOS, Socket.IO, and HTTP resources in order and uses an unref’d 5-second
  forced-exit timer so the fallback does not keep the process alive on its own
  (`src/index.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)
- **RouterOS patch verification and write-timeout helpers extracted for testable
  runtime behavior** — health/CSP/shutdown support code was split into small
  modules to make the hardening logic independently testable
  (`src/health.js`, `src/security/helmetOptions.js`, `src/shutdown.js`)

### Operations

- **`/healthz` now behaves like readiness** — the endpoint returns `503` until
  startup completes or when RouterOS is disconnected, and now includes a
  `startupReady` flag in the JSON body (`src/index.js`, `src/health.js`)
- **Connection-table processing cap metadata** — the connections collector now
  reports the raw total separately from the number of rows processed, exposing
  `processed` and `processingCapped` to make truncation explicit (`src/collectors/connections.js`)
- **Auth failure tracking cap** — the in-memory auth failure map now evicts the
  oldest tracked IPs once it exceeds `maxTrackedIPs`, bounding memory growth
  under probe traffic (`src/auth/basicAuth.js`)
- **Wireless API probe debug logging** — failed wireless capability probes now
  log at debug level instead of failing silently (`src/collectors/wireless.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Info-page logo path normalized** — the about/info page now uses `/logo.png`
  like the rest of the app, avoiding broken image resolution on non-root paths
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Removed stale vendored CSS sourcemap reference** — the checked-in Tabler CSS
  no longer advertises a missing `.map` file, eliminating pointless 404s in
  browser devtools (`public/vendor/tabler.min.css`)
- **`package.json` version now matches app version** — `package.json` was
  still reporting `0.4.8` while `app.js`, the changelog, and `/healthz` all
  reported `0.5.0`; version bumped to `0.5.1` to resolve the mismatch
  (`package.json`)
- **`.log-line` CSS rule added** — `buildLogHtml()` wraps each entry in
  `<div class="log-line">` but no matching rule existed; added `.log-line`
  with `display:block`, `padding`, and a subtle hover highlight
  (`public/index.html`)
- **Log colours now visible in light mode** — `.log-error`, `.log-warning`,
  `.log-debug`, `.log-info` and all topic classes (`.log-dhcp`,
  `.log-wireless`, `.log-firewall`, `.log-system`) had no
  `html[data-theme="light"]` overrides, making several severity levels
  nearly invisible on a light background; 12 light-mode rules added
  (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **RouterOS offline banner** — a yellow warning banner now appears at the
  top of the dashboard whenever RouterOS is not reachable, with a plain-
  English reason (e.g. "Connection refused — is RouterOS reachable at
  192.168.88.1?"). The banner dismisses automatically when the connection
  is restored. Distinct from the red Socket.IO reconnect banner which fires
  only when the browser loses its connection to the MikroDash server itself
  (`public/index.html`, `public/app.js`, `src/index.js`)
- **Container no longer blocks on RouterOS availability** — the startup
  sequence previously called `waitUntilConnected(60000)` in an async IIFE,
  meaning the HTTP server started but collectors never ran if RouterOS was
  unreachable at boot. The startup is now event-driven: collectors start the
  moment the `connected` event fires (whether that is immediately or minutes
  later), and the container stays healthy the entire time. The `ros:status`
  event is broadcast to all connected browser clients on every connection
  state change so the UI always reflects reality (`src/index.js`)
- **Human-readable RouterOS error messages** — raw Node.js network errors
  (`ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOTFOUND`, `ECONNRESET`) and RouterOS
  errors (TLS certificate, authentication) are translated to clear
  actionable messages before being sent to the client (`src/index.js`)

### Tests

- **Added production resilience regression coverage** — new tests cover the
  self-hosted asset/CSP contract, readiness health semantics, forced shutdown
  timer unref behavior, RouterOS write timeout recovery, connection collector
  truncation metadata, and auth failure eviction (`test/production-resilience-regressions.test.js`,
  `test/smoke-fixes.test.js`)

## [0.5.0] — UI Fixes & Security Hardening

### Security

- **Closed `traffic:select` whitelist race** — `_normalizeIfName()` in
  `TrafficCollector` previously allowed `traffic:select` events through when
  `availableIfs` was empty (i.e. before `sendInitialState()` had completed),
  bypassing the interface whitelist entirely. The guard is now inverted: an
  empty whitelist is treated as "not ready" and the event is rejected with a
  console warning rather than passed to the RouterOS API
  (`src/collectors/traffic.js`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Log viewer entries now render on separate lines** — `buildLogHtml()`
  was returning bare `<span>` elements joined with `\n`. Inside a `<div>`
  container, `\n` is collapsed whitespace and produces no visual line break.
  Each entry is now wrapped in a `<div class="log-line">` block element so
  every router log entry occupies its own line. The `flushLogs()` join
  separator is also cleaned up from `'\n'` to `''`
  (`public/app.js`)
- **Notification bell icon now shown on page load** — `updateNotifBtn()` was
  only ever called after an async `Notification.requestPermission()` callback,
  leaving the hardcoded crossed-bell SVG from `index.html` in place for the
  entire session on browsers where permission had already been granted. A
  startup IIFE now reads `Notification.permission` synchronously and calls
  `updateNotifBtn()` immediately so the correct icon is rendered before the
  user sees the topbar (`public/app.js`)
- **SVG network diagram boxes now respect light mode** — `.nd-node`,
  `.nd-count`, `.nd-label`, `.nd-wan-ip`, `.nd-line`, and `.nd-router-bg`
  had hardcoded dark RGBA fill/stroke values with no light-mode override,
  causing the Wired, Wireless, and WAN boxes to remain dark when switching
  themes. Seven `html[data-theme="light"]` CSS rules now override all
  affected SVG classes with light-appropriate colours (`public/index.html`)

### Features

- **`interfaces:error` Socket.IO event** — when `fetchInterfaces()` fails
  during `sendInitialState()`, the server now emits `interfaces:error` with
  the reason string instead of silently resolving to an empty list via
  `Promise.allSettled()`. The client handles this event by showing an
  explicit "Interface list unavailable" placeholder in the interface dropdown
  and logging the reason to the browser console, replacing a silent empty
  dropdown with actionable feedback (`src/index.js`, `public/app.js`)

## [0.4.9] — Deep Code Review Hardening Pass

### Security

- **HMAC-based timing-safe credential comparison** — authentication now
  compares HMAC-SHA256 digests of fixed length via `crypto.timingSafeEqual`,
  eliminating the timing side-channel that leaked credential length through
  the old length-check fast path (`446f2d2`)
- **Dropped unconditional X-Forwarded-For trust** — `getClientIp()` no longer
  reads `X-Forwarded-For` by default, preventing attackers from spoofing their
  IP to bypass rate limiting (`446f2d2`)
- **Sanitized /healthz error strings** — error messages are now truncated to
  200 characters with stack traces stripped before being exposed in the health
  endpoint, preventing internal implementation details from leaking (`faba151`)

### Features

- **Opt-in `TRUSTED_PROXY` env var** — when set to a proxy IP (e.g.
  `127.0.0.1`), Express `trust proxy` is enabled and `req.ip` correctly
  resolves the real client address from `X-Forwarded-For`. Disabled by default
  for safe out-of-the-box behaviour (`8965a31`)
- **Incremental ping updates** — server now emits lightweight `ping:update`
  events with only the latest data point; full history is sent once via
  `ping:history` on client connect, reducing per-tick payload size (`acb8001`)

### Bug Fixes

- **Unified version strings** — `APP_VERSION` is now sourced from
  `package.json` in one place, fixing inconsistencies between the healthz
  endpoint and startup log messages (`157986e`)
- **Removed redundant dynamic require** — `geoip-lite` was being required
  twice (module-level and inside a function); consolidated to module-level
  only (`157986e`)
- **Fixed /api/localcc polling storm** — client-side code moved the
  `fetch('/api/localcc')` call from inside the `conn:update` handler (fired
  every 3 s) to a once-per-connect pattern (`4b9e862`)
- **Decoupled wanIface from process.env** — `DhcpNetworksCollector` now
  receives `wanIface` as a constructor parameter instead of reading
  `process.env.WAN_IFACE` directly, improving testability (`4b9e862`)
- **Pruned stale keys in firewall, VPN, and talkers prev-maps** — all three
  Maps grew unboundedly as rules/peers/devices were added and removed; each
  collector now tracks seen keys per tick and deletes stale entries
  (`010bb46`)
- **Error state consistency** — all 7 collectors now set `lastXxxErr = null`
  on success instead of `delete`, keeping the state object shape stable and
  matching the initial values in `index.js` (`6df3e92`)
- **Per-interface traffic error flag** — replaced the single boolean
  `_hadTrafficErr` with a per-interface `Set`, so an error on one interface
  no longer suppresses first-error logging on others (`6df3e92`)
- **Extracted PING_COUNT constant** — the magic number `3` used in both the
  RouterOS ping command and the loss-calculation fallback is now a named
  constant (`6df3e92`)
- **DOM-based log truncation** — replaced `innerHTML.split('\n')` with
  `childNodes` counting and `removeChild`, avoiding O(n) re-serialization
  of the log panel on every new log line (`faba151`)

### Performance

- **Single-pass connections loop** — merged three separate iterations over
  the connections array (src/dst counts, protocol counts, country/port counts)
  into one loop (`acb8001`)
- **ARP reverse index** — `arp.js` now maintains a `byMAC` Map updated
  atomically in `tick()`, making `getByMAC()` O(1) instead of O(n)
  (`acb8001`)

### Earlier Hardening (prior commits)

  `5009ac9`)
