/**
 * MERGING THE FLEET'S NEIGHBOUR TABLES INTO ONE GRAPH.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS ASKED FOR ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Rebuild the map by adding all the access points and merging into one." The
 * graph is built from one router's tables, so a device on an access point's own
 * port is not on it at all, and a device the core heard through a switch is on
 * it in the wrong place.
 *
 * ── THE RULE IS THE UPLINK, AND THAT IS THE ONLY THING TESTED HERE ──────────
 *
 * A peer's uplink is the interface it sees the viewed router on. Anything it
 * reports on a DIFFERENT interface is behind it; anything on the uplink is
 * beside it. Four cases separate a correct implementation from the three wrong
 * ones that look right on a single fixture:
 *
 *	a device only the peer can see          added, behind the peer
 *	a device the peer sees on another port  moved behind the peer
 *	a device the peer sees on its uplink    left exactly where it was
 *	a peer nothing on the map has heard of  added, so its devices have a parent
 *	a peer that could not be read           counted, not silently dropped
 *
 * The flat-segment case is the third one: every router sees every other on its
 * uplink, so the merge moves nothing. That is the honest answer and it is pinned
 * here so a later "improvement" that guesses cannot land quietly.
