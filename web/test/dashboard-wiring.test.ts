/**
 * Is the Dashboard actually LISTENING?
 *
 * ── THE GAP THIS FILLS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Four card renderers were ported, each with a gate that drives it directly and
 * compares the DOM against the live renderer. All four passed while NOTHING
 * CALLED ANY OF THEM. A renderer that is never invoked still renders correctly
 * when a test invokes it, so a DOM gate cannot tell a wired page from an unwired
 * one — and `event-audit.js` did not catch it either, because the events were
 * emitted by the Go side and consumed by no one: a gap in the CONSUMER, not in
 * the vocabulary.
 *
 * ── IT ASKS THE PORT, IT DOES NOT GREP IT ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The port half RUNS `initDashboard` against a fake socket and records what it
 * subscribes. Grepping for `socket.on('x'` would be a guess about spelling, and
 * this session has lost time to nine such guesses.
 *
 * ── AND THE CARD TABLE IS FORCED TO GROW ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An earlier version tried to DERIVE which live events feed the Dashboard, by
 * looking for handlers that touch a Dashboard element id. It was hopeless in the
 * other direction: with 122 ids on the page and one level of call-following, it
 * claimed `disconnect`, `settings:pages` and `ros:status` as card events. A
 * check whose expected set is that noisy teaches people to ignore it.
 *
 * So the table is EXPLICIT — and kept honest by discovery instead: every
 * `dashboard-*.ts` module in the port must appear in it, so porting a new card
 * fails this gate until its event is named and wired. That is the direction the
 * failure actually comes from.
