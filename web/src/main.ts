  // ── Re-join the page room after a router switch ───────────────────────────
  //
  // Rooms are per-socket AND PER-ROUTER: `router-<id>-page-<name>`. A switch
  // drops every room this socket was in and joins the new router's BASE room
  // only, so a page-scoped collector goes on emitting into a room this browser
  // has just left. The page then shows nothing at all until the user navigates
  // away and back — which looks like the new router having no data.
  //
  // `router:active` is the one signal every path shares: the server sends it on
  // connect, on a switch, and on a hot-swap alike. Reacting to a CHANGE of id
  // re-joins through the ordinary `page:focus` handler, so the role gate is
  // re-applied against the NEW router rather than carried over from the old one.
  //
  // The FIRST one is skipped deliberately — on a fresh connect the room has
  // already been joined by the code that opened the page, and re-emitting would
  // be a second join for the room we are already in.
  //
  // ── AND A RECONNECT IS NOT A CHANGE OF ID, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS MISSED ─────
  //
  // Reacting to a CHANGE of id is right for a switch and silently wrong for a
  // reconnect, because the router has not changed — so `id === roomsRouterId`
  // returned early and `page:focus` was never re-sent. Nothing on the server
  // covers that: room membership is per-CONNECTION, a reconnect arrives as a
  // brand-new `conn` whose `cn.page` is empty, and `rejoinPage` returns
  // immediately on an empty page. `router:select` is re-sent on connect and
  // rejoins the CARDS; the page room had nothing to rejoin it.
  //
  // The result was a browser subscribed to no page room at all, on a socket the
  // server considers healthy — every page-scoped card going stale while the
  // collector polls happily into a room nobody is in. It is the same failure
  // `TestSelectRouterRejoinsEveryPerSocketSubscription` was written for, reached
  // by the other route.
  //
  // MEASURED, 2026-09-07: a WebSocket driven through the real sequence received
  // four `wireless:update` in 75s with `page:focus`, and ZERO in 75s over a
  // reconnect that sent only `router:select`.
  //
  // Keyed on `router:active` rather than on `connect` so the ordering is
  // structural: the server emits it only after it has processed the select, so
  // the session exists by the time this asks for the page.

  // listener lives inside main(), and main.ts runs main() on import.

  // this page is the fleet map's popover and its no-location tray, both of which
  // go through `window._rtrOpenModal`, and both of which belong to the map's
  // unported SVG half.

  // `rtrAddBtn`, `rtrTbody` and the modal's own trigger live on the SETTINGS
  // page (`web/src/ui/page-settings.html`). An earlier version of this file
  // wired `initRouterModal` from here anyway, complete with a
  // `[data-edit-router]` handler for an attribute nothing in the app produces —
  // The selector audit is what said so.
  //
  // THE OPENER NOW EXISTS: `settings-routers.ts` renders the Edit button the
