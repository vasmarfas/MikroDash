 * the edit goes to, and editing an IPv6 route through /ip/route would fail at

 *
 * The identity is round-tripped from `data-identity` rather than looked up in

 * and a `.id` survives a rename, so it addresses a row without identifying it.

 * The earlier ported pages each grew their own version of this that looks the
