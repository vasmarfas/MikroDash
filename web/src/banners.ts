// The two banners, the body classes that go with them, and the topbar clock.
//
// ── TWO DIFFERENT OUTAGES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME ────────────────────────
//
// The RED banner means the BROWSER lost its socket to the MikroDash server.
// The AMBER one means the server is fine and ROUTEROS is unreachable. They are
// separate conditions with separate causes, and the amber one is suppressed
// while the red one is showing: told both, an operator learns nothing from the
// second, and the actionable message is the one about the connection they can
// actually see is down.
//
// ── THE ROUTER'S STATE HAS TO OUTLIVE THE SOCKET ────────────────────────────
//
// `rosDisconnected` is remembered across a reconnect. Without it, a browser that
// reconnects to a server whose router is STILL down clears the red banner and
// shows nothing at all — the most reassuring possible display of a broken
// system. The live app keeps that flag for exactly this reason and so does this.
//
// ── CLASSES, NOT INLINE STYLES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The stylesheet says `#rosBanner{display:none}` and `#rosBanner.show{display:flex}`.
// Toggling `.show` lets the stylesheet decide; writing `style.display` inline
// wins over it permanently, which is the same absent-versus-set trap the
// appearance layer documents. The body classes matter too — `is-disconnected`
// and `is-ros-disconnected` dim the sidebar and main panel and hide the flow
// dots, so omitting them leaves a live-looking UI over dead data.
//
// ── THE EVENT NAME DIFFERS FROM THE LIVE APP, DELIBERATELY ──────────────────
//
// The live server emits TWO events: `ros:status` — this session's RouterOS
// reachability, which drives this banner — and `router:status`, a global
// per-router announcement for the Routers list. This port's server emits one
// `router:status` carrying `{routerId, connected, reason}` for EVERY router, to
// every browser, and main.ts shows it here only when `routerId` is the router on
// screen. It was once room-scoped and answered this banner's question alone;
// the fleet-wide broadcast added later made an ungated banner report other
// routers' outages as this one's.
