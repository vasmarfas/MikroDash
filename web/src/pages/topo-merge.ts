// Merging the other routers' neighbour tables into one graph.
//
// ── WHAT THE MERGE CAN ADD, AND WHAT IT CANNOT ──────────────────────────────
//
// The topology payload is built from ONE router's tables, so its horizon is that
// router's broadcast domain. `/api/topology/peers` reads every other managed
// router's `/ip/neighbor` and this folds them in. Two things come out of it:
//
//	a device no single router could see  — it is on a peer's other port, or on a
//	                                       segment the core never hears
//	a device in the wrong place          — the core heard it, but a peer reports
//	                                       it on a port that is NOT the peer's
//	                                       uplink, which means it is behind that
//	                                       peer and not beside it
//
// THE UPLINK IS THE WHOLE RULE. A peer's uplink is the interface it sees THIS
// router on; anything it reports on another interface is downstream of it. That
// is a fact from the peer's own table rather than an inference about distance.
//
// It moves NOTHING on a flat segment, and that is not a gap to close. Where a
// switch forwards the discovery protocols, every router sees every other on its
// uplink port and no hop information exists to recover — the operator's own
// pins are the answer there, and a SwOS box answers no API at all, so it can
// only ever be a node with a declaration behind it.
//
// PURE, so it is tested by replaying two payloads rather than by opening the
// page against a fleet.
