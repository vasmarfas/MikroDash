// The Dashboard's wiring: what turns four gated renderers into a live page.
//
// ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each card was ported with a gate that drives its renderer directly and
// compares the DOM against the live one. Every one of those passed while
// NOTHING CALLED THE RENDERER — a function that is never invoked still renders
// correctly when a test invokes it, so a DOM gate cannot tell a wired page from
// an unwired one. That is the same shape as the four defects found earlier in
// this port (reorder arrows, schedule buttons, firewall sub-tabs, `rptSchedNew`)
// and it is why `dashboard-wiring-check.js` asserts the subscriptions exist
// rather than trusting that a rendered card implies a listening one.
//
// ── THE SYSTEM CARD NEEDS THREE SIGNALS, NOT ONE ────────────────────────────
//
// Its payload handler is only the first. `_sysMetaWritten` is re-armed on
// CONNECT and on ROUTER SWITCH in the live app — both, because another router is
// another board, and a meta line written once would otherwise keep the old
// board's name under the new router's data. And a tab that was hidden holds its
// last payload pending, so coming back into view has to flush it.

  // which is exactly what it did until Part 65.

  // ── EACH CARD ROOM IS SENT ONCE PER CONNECTION ─────────────────────────────
  //
  // The grid re-syncs its rooms on first paint, on every connect and whenever
  // the dashboard becomes active, and the server replays a card's latest payload
  // on every `dashcard:focus` — so a page load subscribed each card three times
  // and received three replays. The server remembers the subscriptions for the
  // connection (`conn.cards`) and re-joins them on a router select, so one send
  // per connection is all it needs. A disconnect ends that connection's
  // subscriptions, so the record goes with it; a blur ends one room's.

  // ── AND THE TRAFFIC HISTORY, WHICH THIS PORT WAS NOT CLEARING ─────────────
  //
  // The live `connect` handler clears `currentIf` and `allPoints`
  // (`../MikroDash/public/app.js:2957`) for the same reason it resets the meta
  // line one statement earlier. This port cleared them only on a ROUTER SWITCH,
  // so a socket gap left the chart holding samples from before it — the new
  // history arrives and is appended to the old, and the window is drawn across
  // a period during which nothing was being received. A chart that bridges its
  // own outage is the traffic equivalent of a dead router looking alive.
  // resetTrafficOnReconnect, NOT resetTraffic: the full reset also clears the
  // operator's chosen interface, and a reconnect must not. See that function.

  //
  // Guarded on the ROUTER being up, exactly as the live handler is. Flushing
  // while it is down would repaint the card with the last numbers from before
  // the outage, which makes a dead router look alive — the one thing the ROS
  // banner exists to prevent.
  //
  // The live handler also unpauses the topology SVG and restores the traffic
  // chart. Those belong to cards this port has not reached; they join here when
  // they do.
